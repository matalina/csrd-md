(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 295)

Post-apocalyptic literature, movies, and games are a subgenre of science fiction that focuses on the dystopia that follows the fall of civilization. Strictly speaking, post-apocalyptic stories take place after the end of the world. At least, the end of the world for most people. Players take the role of the survivors (or their descendants) trying to persevere in the face of immense hardship. Popular post-apocalyptic scenarios include those set after nuclear war, in the aftermath of a zombie plague, in the months and years following an alien invasion, or after the environment collapses in the face of human overpopulation. Other ways the world could end include a massive meteorite strike, the long-awaited robot uprising, a powerful solar flare that burns out the world's power grids and communications, or even something as prosaic as a global disease pandemic.

## POST-APOCALYPTIC DESCRIPTORS

### QUICK REFERENCE: POST-APOCALYPTIC DESCRIPTORS

**Standard**

- Bitter (RR, 113)
- Hopeful (RR, 116)
- Rusted (RR, 117)
- Shiny (RR, 118)

### ALTERNATE CHARACTER ROLES

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 112)

Characters who play out the apocalypse itself or who have just survived it and must pick up a few hours, days, or months after the end should choose from an alternate slate of roles. If you begin your game in such a setting, it makes much more sense to let your players choose roles for characters in a modern game.

### POST-APOCALYPTIC SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

In addition to descriptors for human survivors, GMs may want to offer species affected by the disaster.

**Editor's Notes â€”** The Species as Descriptor section is worth reading before deciding what will work best for your game.

### BITTER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 113)

Someone you cared for wronged you. They may have done so directly by betraying a trust, stealing your supplies, or giving you up to raiders to save their own life. Maybe they did it indirectly by going missing or dying on you. Or maybe it was an organization or institution that let you down. Whatever it was, you've spent a lot of time pulled into yourself, paranoid and mistrustful of others. But something's happened lately that has at least opened you to the possibility of trusting others again. Maybe you have to work with someone else or die. Alternatively, perhaps you've decided to try one more time, despite your disillusionment. It's either that or fully give in to bitterness.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Skeptical:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You're always wondering who's going to wrong you next. You are trained in detecting deception.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in tracking creatures. If a creature has wronged you, the tracking task is eased.
    
- **Inability:** You have a hard time not letting bitterness stain everything you do. Interaction tasks are hindered.
    
- **Additional Equipment:** You have a keepsake from whoever wronged you. It could be an object they once possessed, a picture of them, or something else you associate with what makes you so bitter.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You found the other PCs in a situation they couldn't survive. Uncharacteristically, you helped them.
2. You were facing certain death, but the PCs saved you, for no reason other than they saw your need.
3. You want to change your ways, and the PCs seem to offer a chance for you to explore that possibility.
4. You have no idea how you joined the PCs. You're just going along with it for now until answers present themselves.

### CANIEN

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 113)

You're an evolved, intelligent dog with the ability to speak and use tools. Some caniens stand upright and have hands, and others are quadrupeds who can use a combination of their front paws and mouth as adroitly as a handed canien; you decide which kind of canien you are. Most canien clothing and equipment accommodates walking on either two feet or four, so that's normally not an issue. Either way, you've got fur, a tail, and a noble dog visage true to your particular line of descent. And like most caniens, you're loyal to your pack and friends. But you may find strangers a little suspicious, in which case you aren't shy about letting them know. However, you're usually willing to entertain the idea that a newcomer may be a friend you just don't know yet.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Dogged:** +2 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are naturally vigilant. You are trained in perception tasks.
    
- **Skill:** You are playful. You are trained in tasks involving playing physical games.
    
- **Loyal:** If an ally within immediate range descends one or more steps on the damage track, you can take an action immediately but in a restricted fashion. You can use this action either to move the willing ally up to an immediate distance or to attempt a healing task on your ally.
    
- **Bite:** You are practiced in making unarmed bite attacks (light weapon). Enabler.
    
- **Chewer:** You are something of an oral fidgeter, like most caniens. After each ten-hour recovery roll, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, you discover you've unconsciously been chewing on a piece of your equipment; it's ruined, at least until it is repaired.
    
- **Inability:** You have a hard time seeing disloyalty in others. Tasks that involve detecting falsehoods are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. One of the other PCs needed help, and you obliged without a second's hesitation.
2. The other PCs were going somewhere, and you came along even though they didn't ask you to.
3. Aggression got the better of you, and now you're running from the fallout of that experience.
4. You feel that one of the other PCs is in danger in some way, and you'd like to help out or keep an eye on them.

### FELIS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 113)

You're an evolved, intelligent cat with the ability to speak and use tools. Felis are equally comfortable running on all fours or standing around in a clowder of other felis gossiping over catswort tea. Your fur is your protection from the elements, but you sometimes wear a harness for your equipment and may adopt boots for rough terrain and hats for fashion or function. Your visage is like that of before-times cats, including piercing, reflective eyes. Like other felis, you are crafty and cautious, unless you feel comfortable with others, in which case you can laze away hours in the sun or a warm spot. But if need be, you are quick to act and are not afraid to use your claws to defend yourself.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Crafty:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You're innately curious. You are trained in tasks involving knowledge, figuring out problems, or solving puzzles.
    
- **Skill:** You are agile. You are trained in tasks involving balancing and movement.
    
- **Darksight:** You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.
    
- **Claws:** You are practiced in making unarmed claw attacks (light weapon). Enabler.
    
- **Light on Your Paws:** You ignore the first 4 points of damage you would otherwise suffer from a fall. Enabler.
    
- **Jumpy:** Like most felis, you are a bit high-strung. Anytime another creature acts with surprise against you, make a difficulty 2 Intellect defense roll. If you fail, the first action you take on your turn is to flee using your full movement away from whoever surprised you.
    
- **Inability:** You often come across as aloof. Tasks that involve positive social interaction are hindered.
    
- **Inability:** You sometimes get lost in new locations you haven't visited before. You have an inability in navigation.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. Everything was fine until you were attacked by a raiding band of "cat-skinners." The PCs helped you fight back or flee.
2. You saw the PCs up to something, and your curiosity got the better of you, so you followed them.
3. One of the other PCs invited you to join after they saw you scheme, plot, or solve a difficult problem.
4. You got lost. The PCs found you and invited you to join their group.

### FLUTTER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 115)

You emerged from the chrysalis with your mind awash in skills instilled while you matured, as well as knowledge handed down from your ancestors. If the stories are true, some of your knowledge comes from even further back, ceded by godlike "humans" who raised flutters into the light of self-knowledge. That was before humans were lost, leaving the world in ruins. Ruins that are now yours to refurbish and rebuild or, as many prefer, to ignore while you instead go your own way. Humans may have created you, but they're gone, and you can decide what you think you owe them, if anything.

As a flutter, you are kin to the much smaller natural moths that still flit by night. But you have an internal skeleton and lungs, and are far larger. For all that, you also have wings, a proboscis, and much thinner limbs than the average animal still roaming the world.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Quick:** +2 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are adept at using your body's natural patterns of camouflage. You are trained in hiding.
    
- **Darksight:** You can see in dim light as though it were bright light and can see in darkness as though it were dim light. Enabler.
    
- **Fragile:** When you fail a Might defense roll to avoid damage, you take 1 extra point of damage.
    
- **Inability:** You are confused by bright light. Perception tasks are hindered in bright light.
    
- **Erratic Flyer:** You can select Hover as if it were on your type's list of tier 1 abilities. Your ability to move as described in Hover is due to your wings. In addition to the base ability described for Hover, if you succeed on a difficulty 2 Intellect roll, you can keep your position in the air instead of drifting with the wind or allowing momentum to move you.
    
    On a failure, you fly erratically as your action, possibly into the ground, a wall, or the midst of enemies you were trying to avoid. Enabler.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. Some piece of knowledge gleaned from your time in the chrysalis made you seek out and join the PCs.
2. The ruins are where knowledge of humans exists, and you heard the PCs were headed there.
3. You overheard the PCs talking about a grand adventure, and you wanted to be part of it.
4. You zigged when you should have zagged and ran headlong into the PCs. They patched you up and you stayed with them.

### HOPEFUL

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 116)

Despite civilization's fall, you're optimistic about what the future could bring, confident that it will be bright. In fact, now that all the old institutions and cares of the world are gone, you hope something better can be rebuilt in its place. It's possible that you're bubbly and full of cheer. But you might instead be quietly confident, your hope revealed by the way you always try again if at first you fail. Being hopeful doesn't mean you're blind to others' faults, but you can hope they will do better next time, which might lead you to be more forgiving than other survivors. After all, when you screw up, you hope others will allow you the same luxury of learning from your mistakes.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Spirited:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** Mental malaise doesn't affect you like it does others. You are trained in Intellect defense tasks.
    
- **Shrug Off Disappointment:** When you fail at a noncombat task and try that task again the very next round, you can apply a free level of Effort toward the success of that task. This benefit effectively alleviates the requirement to apply a level of Effort when retrying failed tasks, at least the first time you retry. Enabler.
    
- **Inability:** You have a lightness of being, but you really feel it when you're physically challenged. Might defense tasks are hindered.
    
- **Inability:** You're spirited but not fast. All movement-related tasks are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The PCs were in a bad spot, and one of the other PCs asked you along to add some perspective.
2. You had a spot of bad luck, but you jumped back in to try something new, hopeful it would work out.
3. To make good on a promise to help, you came with the other PCs.
4. You answered a cry for help when another PC got in over their head.

### MUTANT

Savage forces strong enough to destroy a world left you transformed. Either through latent mutations passed down from ancestors that survived the apocalypse, or because something about you reacts when you're exposed to radiation or some other mutagenic source, you are prone to mutation. You might look relatively similar to others of your species, or you might have one or more obvious physical differences that make it hard to disguise your nature. Not that you necessarily want to hide what you are; you might wish to proudly display what makes you different and, to your mind, better.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Significant Mutations:** Choose which option from the following list you'd like for your mutations. Whichever you choose, it is rolled for randomly; you don't select it.
    
    - Two beneficial mutations rolled randomly.
    - Three beneficial mutations plus one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly
    - One powerful mutation and one harmful mutation, both rolled randomly.
    - One beneficial mutation, one distinctive mutation, and one harmful mutation, all rolled randomly.
- **Distinctive Mutations:** You can choose if you want to have distinctive mutations or not. If you do, choose the number, up to four distinctive mutations, which are rolled for randomly. (If the GM is using the transitory mutations optional rule, you can only choose to have up to three distinctive mutations.)
    
- **Cosmetic Mutations:** You can choose if you want to have cosmetic mutations or not. If you do, choose whether you want one or two cosmetic mutations, which are rolled for randomly. Once all your mutations have been rolled for, work together with the GM to ensure that what's been rolled is a character you want to play.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The other PCs found you in some weird "mutant" chrysalis and pulled you out; you were grateful and joined them.
2. The other PCs were "hunting mutants" but when they found you, they realized they had been misguided.
3. You wanted to get away from a bad situation, so you went with the PCs.
4. The PCs asked you to come along, believing that your particular mutations could be harnessed for the benefit of the mission.

### MORLOCK

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

You have lived your life deep underground in artificial bunkers, hidden from the world's destruction and the brutal scavengers that live above. As a morlock, you have a keen mind for the technology salvaged from the before-time. In fact, every morlock comes of age by fitting a piece of morlock technology to its body to provide enhancement and extend its life. This means that you are part flesh and part machine. Your skin is as pale as milk, except where it's been replaced with strips of metal and glowing circuits.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Enhanced Intelligence:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Cyborg Body:** +2 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.
    
- **Partially Metallic:** +1 to Armor.
    
- **Repair and Maintenance:** As an entity of living flesh and humming machinery, you must first succeed on a difficulty 2 repair task before making a recovery roll. On a failure, the recovery roll is not used; however, the normal rules for retrying apply, and you must use Effort on a new roll if you wish to try again. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can choose to use Effort to heal additional points to your Pools (each level of Effort healing an additional 2 points to your Pools if you succeed).
    
- **Morlock Prejudice:** While among non-morlocks, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The PCs found you in a collapsed subterranean tunnel.
2. The other PCs encountered you exploring underground, and you convinced them to allow you to accompany them.
3. You were exiled from the morlock communities and needed help on the surface.
4. The only way to save the morlock community you hail from is to venture to the surface and find a mechanical part needed to repair a failing ancient system.

### RUSTED

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 117)

Life has dealt you some hard knocks. You lost an eye, an arm, or a leg several years ago, possibly during the apocalypse itself, or perhaps afterward. But you didn't give up. You adjusted, learning to do everything again, despite what first seemed like a limitation. If you lost a limb, you use a prosthetic; if an eye, you sometimes quip that binocular vision is overrated. Sure, there are times when you struggle with discomfort, pain, and possibly even self-consciousness. However, overcoming all that only makes you stronger and more determined to succeed. Ultimately, your scars, your prosthetic (if any), and your story represent who you are: a survivor who overcomes whatever is thrown your way.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Resilient:** +2 to your Might Pool or +2 to your Intellect Pool or +1 to all three Pools.
    
- **Skill:** Hard knocks have toughened you; you are trained in either Might defense tasks or Intellect defense tasks (choose one).
    
- **Skill:** You had to fake it until you made it; you are trained in one creative skill such as singing, writing, acting, composing, public speaking, painting, sculpture, dancing, or something similar.
    
- **Inability:** You've learned to do everything again and, in truth, better than most people ever could. But your injury is real; it's why you sometimes joke that you're "rusted." If you've lost an eye, your perception tasks involving sight are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic leg, tasks requiring movement are hindered. If you rely on a prosthetic arm, tasks involving using both hands are hindered.
    
- **Additional Equipment:** You have a prosthetic for one arm or one leg, or you have an eyepatch (and prosthetic eye) for a missing eye.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You bragged that there's nothing someone else could do that you couldn't do twice as well, which is how you got involved in your current situation.
2. You're afraid of what might happen if the other PCs fail.
3. You were tailing one of the other PCs for reasons of your own, which brought you into the action.
4. You stepped in to defend one of the PCs when that character was threatened. While talking to them afterward, you heard about the group's task.

### SHINY

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 118)

You're brash and bright, and you exult in situations, people, and objects that seem to you as if they have a similar sheen. Literally shiny objects qualify, as well as objects that are not rusted or degraded by time's passage or the effects of the apocalypse. You also tend to fall into the orbit of people who are strong, unbeaten, and possessed of an inner brightness. You believe that they, like you, reflect the light of some greater spiritual purpose in the world. When you believe you are acting in that glow, you are emboldened and may take risks others fear. You don't seek death, but you're confident that death in the pursuit of something shiny is the definition of a life well-lived.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Lithe:** +2 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You've had practice driving a before-times vehicle. Choose a motorcycle, car or truck, or long-haul truck; you're trained in driving that kind of vehicle.
    
- **Skill:** You know how to get out of the way. You are trained in Speed defense tasks.
    
- **Shiny Maneuver:** You know how to push yourself harder, at the risk of a more dramatic failure. When you attempt a shiny maneuver, you ease a task, attack roll, or defense roll, but in doing so you increase the intrusion range by two for that roll, to a 1â€“3 on a d20. If you fail and decide to retry the task (requiring that you spend a level of Effort, as normal), it has the same increased intrusion range. Once you attempt a shiny maneuver, you can't attempt another until you make a recovery roll. Enabler.
    
- **Inability:** You may be lithe and shiny, but you're not sneaky. Tasks related to sneaking and staying quiet are hindered.
    
- **Inability:** You are irrepressible, but that makes it hard to dissemble. Deception and disguise tasks are hindered.
    
- **Additional Equipment:** You have a treasured object that is literally shiny in bright light, such as a polished stainless-steel sphere, a silver coin, a pocket watch from the before-times, or something else small and easily carried.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. It seemed like there were equal odds that the other PCs wouldn't succeed, which sounded good to you.
2. The first word that popped into your head upon seeing the PCs was "shiny."
3. You think the tasks ahead will present you with unique and fulfilling challenges.
4. Someone you trust and respect above all others suggested you join the PCs to help them complete their task.

The Scavenges focus can be used as written in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), but whenever the abilities point to the scavenging rules and tables from the rulebook (including Ruin Lore, Junkmonger, Know Where to Look, and other abilities), use the optional rule for scavenging or repairing and building.

### ROACH

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 301)

You are born of a species of evolved insects once called "cockroach," but that is far in the past. Radiation and forced evolution have radically increased your size, shape, and ability to think. Your exoskeleton mimics the shape of a human being, though not perfectly. When you move about human society, shadows and cloaks are your ally if you wish to pass unnoticed. When those of your kind are discovered, it usually goes poorly for someone. You, however, have a wandering spirit and seek to explore the fallen world and find a new way forward.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Scuttler:** Your Speed Edge increases by 1.
    
- **Sense by Scent:** You can sense your environment even in total darkness.
    
- **Cling:** You can move an immediate distance each round on walls or clinging to the ceiling.
    
- **Carapace:** +1 to Armor.
    
- **Glide:** You can extend small wings from your carapace that grant an asset in jumping tasks and allow you to fall up to a short distance without taking damage.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in disguise tasks.
    
- **Inability:** You are susceptible to disease and poison. Defense rolls against disease or poison are hindered.
    
- **Inability:** You mimic a human, but you are not as fierce. Tasks involving combatâ€” including attack and defense rollsâ€”are hindered.
    
- **Insect Prejudice:** While among non-roaches, all positive interaction tasks are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The PCs didn't realize what you were when they asked for your help.
2. You've managed to hide your roach ancestry so well that everyone thinks you are like them.
3. You are the last of your kind.
4. You have a secret agenda, and the PCs were gullible enough to let you come along.

## ADDITIONAL POST-APOCALYPTIC EQUIPMENT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 299)

### POST-APOCALYPTIC CURRENCY

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 126)

In your setting, you may want a new currency that PCs can use to purchase goods and services that fall into the various price categories. Currency of some sort can be used in places where survivors trust each other enough not to steal or kill for resources. A few options are described here.

- **Loot:** The "loot" result on the Useful Stuff table lists before-times collectibles, such as gold eagle coins, jewelry, and designer wristwatches. A starving survivor would likely scoff at accepting any of these as currency. But in an established community or trade town, such items might retain some value, though they're worth only a fraction of what they were before the apocalypse. In general, the price category for such things is two ranks lower than before the apocalypse.
    
- **Ammunition:**
    

Ammunition as Currency

|Price Category|Rounds of Ammo|
|---|---|
|Inexpensive|1 bullet|
|Moderate|10 bullets|
|Expensive|500 bullets|
|Very expensive|1,000 bullets|
|Exorbitant|10,000 bullets|

- **Seeds:** If stored correctly, seeds might make reasonable currency. Some seeds could be more valuable than others, especially if it could be demonstrated that they are viable. For example, ten viable seeds might be worth an inexpensive item or service.
    
- **Water:** After an apocalypse, clean and drinkable water could become scarce. Measuring out water could become a standard in some locations. Case in point, 1/3 cup (80 ml) of water might be worth an inexpensive item or service.
    
- **Fuel:** Gasoline might be considered liquid gold, assuming working vehicles also exist. However, if you're adhering strictly to the shelf life of common things, you'll also have to include a new source for usable gasoline after all the stuff from the before-times goes bad. For instance, a quarter-gallon (1 L) of gasoline might be worth an inexpensive item or service.
    
- **Drugs:** From over-the-counter painkillers to prescription medications, the drugs found in a pharmacy could be the basis for currency. Over time, they would probably become more valuable because people are likely to go through their treasure hoard of aspirin or antibiotic. Thus, one aspirin or other pain-relief tablet might be worth an inexpensive item or service.
    
- **Scrip:** A large and somewhat organized post-apocalyptic group might produce its own vouchers or tokens to pay its members for services rendered. Such scrip might have value outside the group or be considered worthless, depending on your setting.
    

### POST-APOCALYPTIC EQUIPMENT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 299)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 128)

In a post-apocalyptic setting, the items on the Additional Modern Equipment table as well as the following items might be available in trade from other survivors, or in the rare trade town.

**Editor's Notes â€”** These tables combine contents from [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/) and [Rust and Redemption](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/rust-and-redemption/). Linked items lead to entries from [The Stars are Fire](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/the-stars-are-fire/) for reference, but discrepancies are present due to technology ratings within the genre. For example, a padlock with keys is a level 3 item in a science fiction setting, but a level 5 item in a post-apocalyptic (or modern) setting.

## OPTIONAL RULES FOR THE APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 61)

The optional rules presented in this chapter accommodate a variety of circumstances that PCs could face after civilization falls. Some represent useful information that rarely comes up in other games but is ever present in almost every post apocalyptic game, such as scavenging and how to repair before times machines, the game effects of exposure and starvation, and so on.

Other optional rules support play in the aftermath of a particular type of cataclysm or style of play. If nuclear war destroyed the world, the landscape is likely much different than if a pandemic wiped out most people.

And that's to say nothing of more fantastic elements that can pop up in a post apocalyptic setting, such as the civilization shattering aftereffects of the Christian Judgment Day, kaiju, time storms, and so on.

Most of the rules are meant for the GM's eyes onlyâ€”things that happen behind the scenes or that are secrets the PCs might find out over the course of the game.

**Realistic Versus Fantastic Optional Rules:** Some of the optional rules presented here are for realistic or plausible scenarios like nuclear war or climate change, and some are for fantastic events and settings such as time storms, the return of magic, or incredible mutations. Realistic optional rules usually also apply in games that use one or more fantastic optional rules. Ultimately, it's your choice. Feel free to use some, all, or none of these optional rules when running your game, or introduce others of your own devising (or from another genre sourcebook) to provide a unique twist to the game.

### EXPOSURE, STARVATION, AND DEHYDRATION

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 62)

Codifying the effects of exposure, starvation, and ,dehydration for a tabletop RPG probably makes sense only in a post-apocalyptic scenario, given that survival is a primary theme of the genre.

**When to Use:** If PCs are exposed to the elements, don't have enough food, and/or don't have enough water, their health and life span are directly affected.

#### EXPOSURE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 62)

The human body can withstand temperatures that are too cold for it or too hot for it for a brief period before degrading.

- **Too Cold:** Prolonged exposure to temperatures below 60Â° F (16Â° C) eventually uses up a body's stored energy. The result is hypothermia, when the body loses heat faster than it can produce it. A body temperature that's too low affects the brain, making the target unable to think clearly or move well. Those with adequate clothing and/or shelter appropriate to the environment are protected. Generally, a PC can survive extreme cold for about twenty minutes to about two hours.
    
    In game terms, unprotected characters, or even characters who have less than adequate protection, suffer 1 point of ambient damage per hour in temperatures near or below 32Â° F (0Â° C), or 1 point of ambient damage per round in subzero (âˆ’18Â° C) conditions. In addition, PCs in subzero temperatures with inadequate protection must succeed on a difficulty 4 Might defense roll each hour or descend one step on the damage track.
    
- **Too Hot:** Prolonged exposure to a wet bulb temperature of 95Â° F (35Â° C) is the upper limit of safety, beyond which the human body can't cool itself by evaporating sweat. Heat exhaustion is the result, leading to weakness, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Heat exhaustion can progress to heatstroke, when the body's temperature regulation system fails. Those with adequate shelter or some sort of cooling system are protected. Generally, a PC can survive extreme heat for about twenty minutes to two or three hours.
    
    In game terms, PCs in too hot conditions suffer 1 point of ambient damage per ten minutes. In addition, a character exposed to extreme heat must make a level 4 Might defense roll (hindered if the character is also dehydrated) every ten minutes. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.
    

**Rule of Three:** One popular mnemonic for knowing how long a person can survive in extreme circumstances is the Rule of Three. It goes something like this: You can survive for three minutes without oxygen, you can survive for three days without water, and you can survive for three weeks without food. However, the rule depends on a person not being directly exposed to the environment and not being under physical duress, and requires someone who can hold their breath for three minutes, which is not most people. Usually, in a post-apocalyptic RPG scenario, PCs won't have such luxuries.

#### STARVATION

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 63)

Generally, a PC can survive without food for about ten days to several weeks. In game terms, PCs who go without food take 3 points of ambient damage each day. On any day a PC has taken starvation damage, their tasks are hindered (even if the character makes a recovery roll to regain lost Pool points). In addition, after seven days without food, a starving character must make a level 5 Might defense roll each day that follows. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.

#### DEHYDRATION

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 63)

Generally, a PC can survive without water for three to five days, but this time frame can be shorter in extreme heat or physical activity. In game terms, PCs who go without water take 3 points of ambient damage every twelve hours. On any day a PC has taken dehydration damage, their tasks are hindered (even if the character makes a recovery roll to regain lost Pool points). In addition, after one day without water, a dehydrated character must succeed on a level 5 Might defense roll each day. On a failed roll, the character descends one step on the damage track.

### RADIATION IN THE REAL WORLD

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 63)

Exposure to dangerous amounts of radiation can cause severe damage to the human body, including cellular mutations, cancer, and death.

Methods to detect and mitigate radiation are useful to avoid stumbling into it in the first place, as described in the next section. Dangerous radiation harms and eventually kills people and other creatures, as described under the sections that follow.

Use this optional rule to evoke a more realistic approach to dangerous radiation. You could also use it in a setting with fantastic elements as a baseline effect, even if for some, exposure also leads to the potential for incredible mutations.

**When to Use:** If nuclear war led to the apocalypse, regions of dangerous radiation linger in the aftermath. Even if you predicate that civilization fell for some other reason, radiation could still be a hazard: a few nuclear bombs may have since been launched by a doom driven survivor group that found an old silo, a before times nuclear power plant went critical and PCs must access it, alien invaders used weapons that left behind radioactive scars, or just because.

#### TELLTALE SIGNS OF RADIATION

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 63)

- **Confirming the Presence of Radiation:** If PCs have a functioning radiation detecting device, it confirms whether an area is radioactive. Otherwise, they can attempt a difficulty 4 Intellect roll to correctly correlate the telltale signs of a radiation hazard with its actual presence. Even if PCs fail this roll, they still understand that some kind of dangerous residue is blighting the area, whether it's radiation, poison, evil spirits, nanites, or something else.
    

#### RADIATION DAMAGE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 64)

Especially intense radiation, such as might be found at the center of an area bearing telltale signs of contamination, harms PCs soon after they are exposed.

- **Immediate Effects of Exposure:** When PCs are exposed to dangerous radiation without shielding, they suffer 3 points of ambient damage per minute each time they fail a difficulty 3 Might defense task; on a success they still take 1 point of ambient damage. If they spend more than ten minutes in the area, or fail three Might defense rolls against radiation during any single period of radiation exposure, they are subject to radiation sickness.
    
    A character who has scavenged, repaired, or cobbled together a hazmat suit is still vulnerable, though less so. The suit eases a wearer's Might defense tasks, though the wearer takes 1 point of ambient damage (because the suit provides +2 to Armor against damage from radiation) every few minutes with each failed defense roll. Unless they tear their suit or are otherwise compromised, they're generally not subject to radiation sickness.
    

#### DISEASE: RADIATION SICKNESS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 64)

**Level 8 disease:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fatigue appear within minutes to hours of a PC contracting radiation sickness. Hours later, the PC may suffer skin burns and hair loss. Days later, they experience extreme weakness, weight loss, and potentially death.

Each day the PC fails a Might defense roll, they descend one step on the damage track. If they succeed on three Might defense rolls, they gradually improve and throw off the sickness effects within a few weeks.

**Dangerous radiation:** Level 3

Taking iodine tablets eases Might defense rolls against radiation sickness by three steps.

### SCAVENGING

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 296)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 64)

Survivors need food and shelter in a world turned upside down. Characters in a post-apocalyptic setting must usually spend part of each day scavenging for supplies or a place of safety.

**When to Use:** PCs in a post apocalyptic setting that aren't prepared or that have lost access to their resources and base must usually spend part of each day scavenging for supplies and/or a place of safety. Scavenging is what happens anytime they search for food, water, and shelter.

#### FOOD, WATER, AND SHELTER

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 296)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 65)

PCs in a post apocalyptic game may find themselves without food, water, shelter, and/or refuge for any number of reasons, including because that's the situation you start them in, they're exploring a new area, their settlement was overrun by raiders and they barely escaped with their lives, or something else.

Generally, characters must spend ten minutes to an hour searching through the rubble and ruins in a particular area before they have a chance of finding food or a refuge.

Characters who succeed in finding food and water or refuge also get to roll up to once each day on the Useful Stuff table and three times on the Junk table. (Some characters won't care about rolling on the Junk table; no need to have them make rolls if that's the case.) If a "food" or "water" result is obtained on the Useful Stuff table, PCs discover double the amount of resources and have enough for two days for six people.

- **Food:** Found food often takes the form of canned, processed, dried, or otherwise preserved goods from before the apocalypse, but sometimes it includes fresh fruits and vegetables growing wild or cultivated by other survivors.
    
- **Water:** Found water might be canned seltzer water, water in casks, water in tanks, and other leftovers from the before times, but it could just as easily be collected rainwater, from a river, from a lake, or water secured by previous survivors.
    
- **Shelter:** Safe places to hole up include homes, RVs, offices, apartments, or any location that can be secured and defended and isn't radioactive, poisoned, or overrun with hostile creatures.
    

Consider using a GM intrusion to add additional color by way of an unexpected threat or hazard as they search, especially if they roll a 1 on their task. It's a dangerous world, and the PCs are not the only ones out scavenging for resources.

#### USEFUL STUFF

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 297)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 66)

Food, water, and a safe place to rest are the most important results for any scavenging task. But other obviously useful stuff is often found along with these basic requirements.

- **When to Consult the Table:** When a group of characters successfully finds food and water or a safe place, they also find something else that's potentially useful. Consult the Useful Stuff table up to once per day, or two or three times if PCs roll a special minor or major effect, respectively. If it's the first day they have scavenged in a particular area, each character might find something useful on the table, but on subsequent days, a group normally gets only a single roll.
    
- **Loot:** "Loot" includes collectible coins from before the apocalypse, such as silver dollars and gold eagles. It also includes jewelry and artwork that survived the disaster and related material that can be used as currency or barter when the characters find other survivors or arrive at a trade town.
    
- **Levels:** Most of the time, it's not important to know the level of a useful item PCs find. If it becomes important, level 3 is a good baseline. If the item is particularly fragile (such as a wheel of cheese preserved in wax), drop the level by 1 or 2. If the item is particularly hardy (like a fire engine), increase the level by 1 or 2.
    
- **Price Categories:** Items found on the Useful Stuff table are generally expensive or exorbitant items (except for firearms, which start in the expensive category).
    
- **Subtables:** Roll on a specific subtable only if you wish to provide additional flavor to what PCs find.
    
- **Useful?** The implication is that if PCs find something on the Useful Stuff table, it's in working condition, having beaten the odds of degradation and destabilization facing all common things from the before times. A GM intrusion, of course, could complicate that for any given item.
    
- **Artifact?** Almost every nonfood item on the Useful Stuff table could be considered an artifact, given that it is increasingly difficult to produce or preserve. Adding a depletion roll (usually 1 in 1d20) represents the likelihood that the item will fall apart, break down, or run out.

### JUNK

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 298)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 70)

Scavenging always turns up junk, most of it unusable because the underpinnings of civilization that it required to functionâ€”such as a power grid and/or a worldwide internetâ€”no longer exist. Characters are free to ignore that junk. But some PCs might have a use for it. That includes PCs with the Scavenges focus, as well as any character that decides to take advantage of the Repairing and Building section described in this optional rule.

- **When to Consult the Table:** All characters gain up to three results from the Junk table each time they successfully scavenge for food and water, or a safe place to stay. Junk can sometimes be repaired. It can also be disassembled, warped, melted, or otherwise used to craft or repair something else.
    
- **How Much Junk PCs Get:** Each time PCs roll on the Junk table or otherwise obtain a specific kind of junk, the amount they get is called a "load." Load is an intentionally vague amount, because it represents a variable amount of junk of a particular kind. A PC that finds some electronic junk could grab a single broken electric fan or leave a ruined house with a shopping cart full of stereo parts. Either way, it's considered one load of electronic junk.
    
- **Tracking Loads:** It's only important to track the number and kinds of loads a PC acquires if they're going to use the Repairing and Building optional rules presented later in this section. A PC can carry one load of junk along with their equipment. To carry more than that, they need a plan, such as using a toy wagon, shopping cart, sled, vehicle, or mount; asking an ally for help; or something else.
    

Junk

|d10|Item Found|
|---|---|
|1|Electronic (stereo, DVD/Blu ray player, smartphone, electric fan, printer, router, _etc._)|
|2|Plastic (lawn furniture, baby seat, simple toys, inflatable pool, _etc._)|
|3|Chemical (cleaning solution, fuel, paint, rat poison, solvents, industrial chemicals, _etc._)|
|4|Metal (old playsets, grills, empty barrels, frying pan, metal siding, _etc._)|
|5|Glass (vases, windows, bowls, decorative pieces, _etc._)|
|6|Textile (coats, pants, shirts, bathing suits, blankets, rugs, paper currency, _etc._)|
|7|Vehicle (car/airplane/watercraft bodies, scavenged electronics, tires, seats, _etc._)|
|8|Construction (cinder blocks, lumber, siding, wiring, pipes, bricks, insulation, shingles, _etc._)|
|9|Medical (syringes, IV pumps, defibrillators, microscopes, centrifuges, CT scanners, _etc._)|
|10|Unearthly (weird components, alloys, and materials scavenged from alien spacecraft)|

**Editor's Notes â€”** The Junk table from the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/) is omitted in favor of the one presented in [Rust and Redemption](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/rust-and-redemption/).

### REPAIRING AND BUILDING

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 71)

- **Improvised Basis for Repairing and Building:** In the aftermath, survivors use whatever they can scavenge to repair, craft, and build. The upshot is twofold. First, things survivors have repaired or built have a more rough-and-ready look to them. A new or repaired home could be covered in scavenged street signs. Clothing is probably a mishmash of textiles, salvaged bits from costume stores, and plastic bags. A suit of armor might be made of trash can lids. And so on. Second, even if something looks rough-and-ready, such as armor made of trash can lids, if PCs succeed on the task to create medium armor (or heavy armor, if they're feeling ambitious), the resulting armor is functionally equivalent to armor of the same grade made before the apocalypse. It just looks less polished.
    
- **Improving the Odds:** If PCs scavenge exactly the right tools for the job (such as a hammer instead of a rock) and/or the perfect construction and repair supplies (such as steel screws instead of pegs carved from wood), they may gain an asset to their task.
    
- **Junk Required for Building vs. Repairing:** The "Loads of Junk Required" column in the Repairing and Crafting Difficulty and Time table is calibrated for repair. If a PC builds something from scratch (as opposed to repairing something previously built), the junk requirements are twice to ten times the indicated number of loads. Something small to moderate (like an article of clothing or a wheelbarrow) requires double the loads, while something large, like a structure or large motorized vehicle, could require up to ten times the indicated junk loads. You, the GM, decide what's reasonable.
    
- **Other Projects:** If the character wants to try to repair or build something from the ground up that isn't on the table, use your best judgment, comparing to what is on the table as a baseline. Some things just can't be built with the tools, materials, and knowledge the PCs have available. For instance, they probably can't build a spacecraft. On the other hand, perhaps they can repair one if they find an old government base containing a secret orbital craft that was never used, as long as they find specialized tools and instructions to go with it.
    
- **Repair and Build Time:** PCs who reduce the difficulty of a project cannot, generally speaking, reduce the repair or build time indicated. If they want to go faster anyway, you can call it a rush job (with appropriate consequences) as described in Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game.
    

### EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 72)

Sometimes, a piece of equipment a PC relies on breaks. Use a GM intrusion to let the character know. PCs who knowâ€”or who learnâ€”that equipment wear and breakage is a possibility can be proactive. They can spend about an hour on equipment maintenance each week. Maintenance requires the PC to expend 1 load of metal or construction junk each week, or to break down a few related items of scavenged useful stuff to get what they need. If PCs put in the time to keep their gear in good condition, they should face fewer, if any, GM intrusions related to their equipment failing them. No roll is required for maintenance, and after PCs commit to this practice, it's usually not important to track the time thereafter, unless a special circumstance occurs.

**When to Use:** Use this optional rule to add a bit more verisimilitude to living in a world where you can't easily replace a broken appliance or tool by buying something online. This rule works well with the Repairing and Building section of the larger optional rule for scavenging, repairing, and building, because if something breaks due to lack of maintenance, PCs should have a chance to fix it.

#### REPAIRING AND CRAFTING DIFFICULTY AND TIME

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 72)

_Loads of junk required for buildings (vs. repairing) are two to ten times the indicated values._

### ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 73)

Many popular post-apocalyptic stories feature salvage in the form of highly advanced or even alien technology.

If fantastic and advanced devices exist in the setting, PCs can find them. If something is advanced and/or alien enough, PCs may have to develop special skills to use it, as noted hereafter. The existence of this tech in your setting may also imply the existence of other fantastic rules in your game, such as grey goo or terraforming by aliens, but the tech could just as easily stand alone or be part of an End of Days theme.

**When to Use:** If the apocalypse that ended your world featured a time rip, alien invaders, a catastrophic alien ship crash, a starting date that is several decades into our own future, or an alternate timeline where things happened differently in the past than in the real world, this rule is applicable. You can also use it if you just want to introduce a bit of mystery to your game that will confound PCs' expectations on how their world really ended.

#### ADVANCED ARTIFACTS AND FANTASTIC MANIFEST CYPHERS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 74)

In a setting featuring remnants of advanced and/or alien technology, PCs scavenging for supplies or defeating foes could discover unusual objects in the form of fantastic cyphers and unusual post apocalyptic artifacts.

#### UNDERSTANDING ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 74)

Recognizing and using unfamiliar technology is difficult enough. If something is especially advanced or alien, it's even harder.

- **Identifying and Using Advanced and Alien Tech:** When a character finds a manifest cypher or an artifact that falls into this category, they must identify it before they can use it. Identification takes from one to ten minutes and a successful Intellect roll, usually against a difficulty of 5. Identifying an object grants PCs the ability to use the object, whether it's a manifest cypher or an artifact.
    
    However, without training or specialization in alien technology, advanced technology, or something similar (which most starting characters don't have), a character has an inability in understanding advanced and alien tech.
    
- **Failing to Understand:** Sometimes a failed roll to understand an object of advanced or alien tech simply means the character can't figure it out, but they can try again (as usual, each task retry requires that the PC expend Effort). Other times, there's a chance of something going wrong, either because you intrude or because the character triggers an intrusion. Use the following table to inspire appropriate GM intrusions or anytime something disruptive happens to an advanced or alien device in a PC's possession.
    

#### ADVANCED AND ALIEN TECH GM INTRUSIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 74)

Unless the advanced device detonates or is otherwise noted as becoming nonfunctional, PCs with the time can try to understand how to use it again after resolving the intrusion.

Advanced and Alien Tech GM Intrusions

|d10|Result of Intrusion|
|---|---|
|1|Ooze sprays the character, then hardens, trapping them until they can escape a level 4 "shell."|
|2|Device becomes stuck in midair, immovable as if caught in invisible, otherwise intangible cement.|
|3|Device grows increasingly hot over the course of one minute, then fuses into a nonfunctional lump.|
|4|Device shoots like a bullet in a random direction for a long distance, lodging itself in a structure or tree.|
|5|Very bright light flashes from the device, blinding the PC for a few minutes.|
|6|A blue light on the device begins flashing; if device is not destroyed, an alien enthraller investigates.|
|7|Device function is triggered, as are any other devices (cyphers and/or artifacts) the PC carries.|
|8|Mutagenic energy pulse; character develops a distinctive mutation over the course of ten hours.|
|9|Device breaks in half (becoming nonfunctional) and spills some sort of grey goo on the character.|
|10|Device detonates, inflicting damage equal to its level on everything within short range on a failed Speed defense roll, or 2 points of damage even with a successful roll.|

### INCREDIBLE MUTATIONS

#### QUICK REFERENCE: INCREDIBLE MUTATIONS

- Mutated Creatures, Plants, and NPCs (RR, 75)
- Transitory Mutations (RR, 75)
- Beneficial Mutations (RR, 78)
- Harmful Mutations (RR, 79)
- Powerful Mutations (RR, 80)
- Distinctive Mutations (RR, 82)
- Cosmetic Mutations (RR, 84)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 75)

Exposure to dangerous amounts of radiation inflicts damage. Enough exposure causes cellular mutations, cancer, and death, as described under Radiation in the Real World. However, in the right game setting, radiation (or genetic engineering, or some other mutagen) can instill strange new abilities in previously normal creatures, plants, NPCs, and even PCs, though often with a few drawbacks, too.

This section describes several ways to introduce incredible mutations to your game, including letting the environment evoke the concept, PC opt in, transitory mutations PCs have less control over, and transitory mutations based on cyphers. You can pick one or two, or use them all at different times and for different needs in your game.

**When to Use:** If you'd like your setting to include incredible mutations, this section is for you. Why does your game have such mutations? Maybe because of an X factor in some survivors' DNA, inscrutable nanites that have permeated the environment, magical contamination, or multiple different timelines collapsing into one.

#### MUTATED CREATURES, PLANTS, AND NPCS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 75)

The environment can reflect the possibility of mutagenic presence even if PCs haven't yet been affected. The appearance of a creature, plant, or NPC often reveals the presence and severity of a mutation. Some creatures and animals may have only harmful mutations, but others could have adaptive mutations.

**Harmful Mutations:** Some creatures, plants, trees, fungus, and NPCs could present with disturbing, harmful mutations, such as the following examples. Their tasks are usually hindered.

- An animal with one or more additional, vestigial, limp limbs, or an additional vestigial head that appears almost as a tumor like growth
- Oozing a smelly, rotting fluid that stains and slightly burns exposed skin
- Lack of fur combined with albinism, making them sensitive to light and subject to skin cancer
- Too many extra fingers or arms, making them slow and heavy
- Too many extra branches, or too spindly, making the branches prone to breaking
- Feathers growing where they normally wouldn't, in ragged, uncomfortable clumps
- Fishlike scales growing where they normally wouldn't, like itchy, reflective sores
- Single limb or other body part is radically larger than normal, making the creature clumsy
- Big clumps of fungal growth that are obviously intrusive and painful

**Adaptive Mutations:** A disturbing mutation might only look strange and not be an impediment to the animal, plant, or NPC. It might even provide some benefit, as follows.

- Fur, hair, or leaves growing in strange fractal patterns. Maybe it glows visibly to attract prey, or glows at a frequency normally invisible to the human eye, but which they can see, allowing them to act in the dark.
- Tentacle like arms that work like the regular limb replaced, or an extra tentacle like arm that gives the creature a method to grasp, use tools, or otherwise gain an additional benefit over other creatures or plants of its type.
- Feathers growing on an animal or plant they normally wouldn't, thick enough to provide additional warmth, protection, and possibly limited flight options.
- Insects, like ants or beetles, that learn how to spin webs, or spiders that begin spinning wildly strong fractal webs that glow and change, maybe serving as a mode of communication.
- Fungal growths that seem to connect the minds of creatures that have the same kind of growth.

#### OPTIONAL RULE: MUTANT DESCRIPTOR

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 76)

If a PC wants to play a mutant, they may do so by choosing Mutant as their descriptor. Mutations gained by a character with the Mutant descriptor are always rolled randomly, although you should work with your player to ensure that the resulting PC is one that the player wants to play.

#### OPTIONAL RULE: TRANSITORY MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 75)

Use this optional rule if you'd prefer some flux in what mutations the PCs have available. A volatile mutation is one that mutates into something different over time. When using this rule, a volatile mutation arises spontaneously or is triggered, replacing the specific benefit (or drawback) of the volatile mutation previously granted to the PC.

You can use this optional rule instead of the mutant descriptor optional rule, or allow both in the same game. If using transitory mutations, not every PC in your game needs to have a volatile mutation.

**Volatile Mutations:** A character can begin the game with one volatile mutation that changes during play, one distinctive mutation that usually does not change, and, at their option, one or two cosmetic mutations.

Alternatively, the PC could gain a volatile mutation (and one distinctive mutation) after their first encounter with radiation or some other mutagenic agent. Additional encounters with radiation don't give a PC further volatile mutations but could cause the one they have to mutate into something else.

If the PC gains a volatile mutation, roll randomly on the Beneficial Mutations table. That mutation lasts until a triggering event occurs, at which time their volatile mutation is replaced, as indicated. A character normally cannot trigger replacement simply by willing it to occur, but they could choose to fail the Intellect defense roll that some triggers require to maintain their current volatile mutation.

**Adjusting the Volatility:** Choose which triggering events apply to determine how volatile you'd like transitory mutations to be in your setting. For instance, if you prefer that volatile mutations change only when PCs encounter radiation, choose that option and ignore the others. Alternatively, you might prefer more variability and use most or even all the triggering events noted.

- The character finishes a ten-hour recovery; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutation.
    
- A character takes damage for the first time in ten hours and fails a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutation, assuming the character's roll isn't a 1, 19, or 20.
    
- The character triggers or receives a GM intrusion; replace with a random roll on the Harmful Mutations table.
    
- The character gains a minor effect on a d20 roll and decides the effect is that their volatile mutation changes; replace with two randomly rolled beneficial mutations. Both are replaced the next time the character gains a new volatile mutation.
    
- The character gains a major effect on a d20 roll and decides the effect is that their volatile mutation changes; replace with a random result from the Powerful Mutations table. It is replaced the next time the character gains a new volatile mutation.
    
- The character takes damage from radiation (or other established mutagen in your setting) for the first time in ten hours and fails an Intellect defense roll against a difficulty equal to the attack; replace with a randomly rolled beneficial mutations, assuming the character's roll isn't a 1, 19, or 20.
    

**Cyphers as Volatile Mutations:** If a character has volatile mutations, one way to handle it is to give them an additional subtle cypher slot, and their volatile mutation is whatever subtle cypher is in that slot. A character can begin the game with one cypher volatile mutation that changes during play (or gain it after surviving radiation damage) and one distinctive mutation that usually does not change, plusâ€”at their optionâ€”one or two cosmetic mutations.

A cypher volatile mutation operates almost entirely like regular volatile mutations, except as follows.

- Any random roll on the Beneficial Mutations table should instead be a random roll on the Subtle Cypher table. That includes the two rolls granted to PCs who use a special minor effect to replace their volatile mutation's effect.
    
- A roll of 1 still replaces the PC's volatile mutation with a randomly rolled harmful mutation.
    
- A roll of 20 still replaces the PC's volatile mutation with a randomly rolled powerful mutation.
    
- A cypher volatile mutation can be used more than once before it is replaced, but each additional attempt to use it requires that the character succeed on an Intellect task. The difficulty of the task begins at the level of the cypher and increases by one step each additional time the character attempts to reuse the mutation. On a failed roll, the mutation is replaced.
    
- When the cypher volatile mutation is replaced, roll the level for the new mutation.
    

#### OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF VOLATILE MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 76)

If a character gains a mutation that grants them points to a Pool (such as strengthened bones, which gives +5 Might), then later loses it, the maximum value in their Pool goes back to what it was before. This might or might not affect their current Pool value, depending on whether they were completely healthy or not.

#### BENEFICIAL MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 78)

The following mutations do not require any visible changes or distinctions in the character. In other words, people who have these mutations are not obviously recognized as mutants. Using beneficial mutations never costs stat Pool points and never requires an action to "activate."

Beneficial Mutations

|d100|Beneficial Mutation|
|---|---|
|01â€“05|**Strengthened bones:** You gain +5 to your Might Pool.|
|06â€“10|**Improved circulation:** You gain +5 to your Might Pool.|
|11â€“15|**Improved musculature:** You gain +5 to your Might Pool.|
|16â€“20|**Improved nervous system:** You gain +5 to your Speed Pool.|
|21â€“25|**Improved neural processes:** You gain +5 to your Intellect Pool.|
|26â€“30|**Thick hide:** You gain +1 to Armor.|
|31â€“33|**Increased lung capacity:** You can hold your breath for five minutes.|
|34â€“36|**Adhesion pads:** Your hands and feet have naturally adhesive pads and thus are assets in tasks involving climbing, keeping your footing, or retaining your grip.|
|37â€“39|**Slippery skin:** You secrete a slippery oil, giving you an asset in any task involving slipping from another's grip, slipping from bonds, squeezing through a small opening, and so on.|
|40â€“45|**Telekinetic shield:** You reflexively use telekinesis to ward away attacks, giving you an asset in Speed defense tasks.|
|46â€“50|**Suggestive voice:** Your voice is so perfectly modulated that it is an asset in all interaction tasks.|
|51â€“53|**Processor dreams:** When you sleep, you process information so that after you wake, you have an asset in any Intellect actions held over from the previous day. For example, if you have to determine whether an unknown plant is poisonous, you could "sleep on it" and make the determination the next day with an asset on the action.|
|54â€“60|**Poison immunity:** You are immune to all poisons.|
|61â€“65|**Disease immunity:** You are immune to all diseases.|
|66â€“70|**Fire resistance:** You have +3 to Armor against damage from fire.|
|71â€“75|**Cold resistance:** You have +4 to Armor against damage from cold.|
|76â€“80|**Psychic resistance:** You have +3 to Armor against Intellect damage.|
|81â€“85|**Acid resistance:** You have +5 to Armor against damage from acid.|
|86â€“88|**Puncture resistance:** You have +2 to Armor against damage from puncturing attacks.|
|89â€“91|**Slicing resistance:** You have +2 to Armor against damage from slicing attacks.|
|92â€“94|**Bludgeoning resistance:** You have +2 to Armor against damage from crushing attacks.|
|95â€“96|**No scent:** You cannot be tracked or located by scent, and you never have offensive odors.|
|97â€“99|**Scent:** You can sense creatures, objects, and terrain by scent as well as a normal human can by sight. You can detect scents with that degree of accuracy only in short range, but you can sense strong odors from much farther away (far better than a normal human can). Like a hound, you can track creatures by their scent.|
|00|**Sense material:** You can sense the presence of any single substance within short range, although you don't learn details or the precise location. You and the GM should work together to determine the substance: water, iron, plastic, granite, wood, flesh, salt, and so on. You do not need to concentrate to sense the material.|

#### HARMFUL MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 79)

Unless noted otherwise, the following mutations are visible and obvious. They offer no benefits, only drawbacks.

Harmful Mutations

|d100|Harmful Mutation|
|---|---|
|01â€“10|**Deformed leg:** All movement tasks are hindered.|
|11â€“20|**Deformed face/appearance:** All pleasant interaction tasks are hindered.|
|21â€“30|**Deformed arm/hand:** All tasks involving the arm or hand are hindered.|
|31â€“40|**Malformed brain:** All memory- or cognitive-related tasks are hindered.|
|41â€“45|**Mentally vulnerable:** All Intellect defense tasks are hindered.|
|46â€“50|**Slow and lumbering:** All Speed defense tasks are hindered.|
|51â€“60|**Sickly:** All Might defense tasks are hindered.|
|61â€“63|**Horrible growth:** A large goiter, immobile tendril, or useless extra eye hangs from your face, hindering all pleasant interactions (with most creatures, particularly humans).|
|64â€“66|**Useless limb:** One of your limbs is unusable or missing.|
|67â€“71|**Useless eye:** One of your eyes is unusable or missing. Tasks specifically involving eyesight (spotting, searching, and so on) are hindered.|
|72â€“76|**Useless ear:** One of your ears is unusable or missing. Tasks specifically involving hearing are hindered.|
|77â€“84|**Weakness in Might:** Any time you spend points from your Might Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.|
|85â€“92|**Weakness in Speed:** Any time you spend points from your Speed Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.|
|93â€“00|**Weakness in Intellect:** Any time you spend points from your Intellect Pool, the cost is increased by 1 point.|

#### CRIPPLING MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 79)

A sixth category exists that might be called crippling or nonviable mutations. PCs never have this kind of mutation. Mutants with nonviable mutations might be born without limbs, with barely functional lungs, without most of their brain, and so on. Such mutations prevent a character from being viable.

#### POWERFUL MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 80)

The following mutations do not require any visible changes in the character until used. People who have these mutations are not obviously recognized as mutants if they don't use their powers. Using some of these mutations costs stat Pool points. Some are actions.

Powerful Mutations

|d100|Powerful Mutation|
|---|---|
|01â€“05|- **Darksight:** You can see in complete darkness as if it were light. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|06â€“10|- **No breath:** You do not need to breathe. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|11â€“15|- **No water:** You do not need to drink water to survive. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|16â€“20|- **Chameleon skin:** Your skin changes colors as you wish. This is an asset in tasks involving hiding. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|21â€“24|- **Savage bite:** Your mouth widens surprisingly, and hidden, pointed teeth emerge when you wish it. You can make a bite attack that inflicts 3 points of damage. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|25â€“26|- **Gluey globs:** You can produce gluey globs at your fingertips. This is an asset in tasks involving climbing or keeping your grip. You can also fling these globs in immediate range, and if they hit, they hinder the target's physical tasks for one round. Enabler to use in a task; action to use as an attack. (RR, 80)|
|27â€“30|- **Face dancing:** You can alter your features enough to give you an asset in all tasks involving disguise. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|31â€“35|- **Sense oddity:** You can sense the presence of an object or creature possessing fantastic abilities (because of alien technology, transdimensional interference, nanites, or similar) within short range. You do not learn details or the precise location. Action. (RR, 80)|
|36â€“40|- **Stinger in finger:** You can make an attack with your hand that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, your stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action. (RR, 80)|
|41â€“44|- **Stinger in elbow:** You can make an attack with your elbow that inflicts 2 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, your stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action. (RR, 80)|
|45â€“47|- **Spit needles:** You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a needle that inflicts 1 point of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, the needle also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). Action. (RR, 80)|
|48â€“50|- **Spit acid:** You can make an attack with immediate range. You spit a glob of acid that inflicts 2 points of damage. Action. (RR, 80)|
|51â€“53|- **Spit webs:** You can make up to 10 feet (3.5 m) of a strong, ropelike material each day at the rate of about 1 foot (30 cm) per minute. The webbing is level 3. You can also spit globs of webbing in immediate range, and if they hit, the target's physical tasks are hindered for one round. Action. (RR, 80)|
|54â€“59|- **Filtered lungs:** You have an asset to Might defense rolls against vapors or noxious gases. You can survive in a hostile breathing environment (such as underwater or in a vacuum) for up to ten minutes. Enabler. (RR, 80)|
|60â€“62|- **Disruptive field (electronics) (2 Intellect points):** When you wish it, you disrupt devices within immediate range (no roll needed). All devices operate as if they were 3 levels lower while in range of your field. Devices reduced to level 0 or below do not function. Action. (RR, 81)|
|63â€“65|- **Disruptive field (flesh) (2 Intellect points):** When you wish it, you disrupt flesh within immediate range. All creatures within range of your field take 1 point of damage. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage rather than affect the difficulty, each target takes 2 additional points of damage. If your attack fails, targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action. (RR, 81)|
|66â€“68|- **Disruptive field (thoughts) (1 Intellect point):** When you wish it, you disrupt thoughts within immediate range. Intellect actions for all creatures within range are hindered. Action. (RR, 81)|
|69â€“70|- **Magnetic flesh:** You attract or repel metal when you desire. Not only do small metal objects cling to you, but this mutation is an asset in tasks involving climbing on metal or keeping your grip on a metal item. This mutation is an asset to Speed defense tasks when being attacked by a metal foe or a foe with a metal weapon. Enabler. (RR, 81)|
|71â€“73|- **Gravity negation (2 Intellect points):** You float slowly into the air. If you concentrate, you can control your movement at half your normal speed; otherwise, you drift with the wind or with any momentum you have gained. This effect lasts for up to ten minutes. Action to initiate. (RR, 81)|
|74â€“80|- **Telepathy (2 Intellect points):** You can speak telepathically with others who are within short range. Communication is two-way, but the other party must be willing and able to communicate. You don't have to see the target, but you must know that it's within range. You can have more than one active contact at once, but you must establish contact with each target individually. Each contact lasts up to ten minutes. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use a level of Effort to increase the duration of contact to a full day. Action to establish contact. (RR, 81)|
|81â€“85|- **Pyrokinesis (1 Intellect point):** You can cause a flammable object you can see within immediate range to spontaneously catch fire. If used as an attack, this power inflicts 2 points of damage. Action. (RR, 81)|
|86â€“90|- **Telekinesis (2 Intellect points):** You can exert force on objects within short range. Once activated, your power has an effective Might Pool of 10, a Might Edge of 1, and an Effort of 2 (approximately equal to the strength of a fit, capable, adult human), and you can use it to move objects, push against objects, and so on. For example, you could lift and pull a light object anywhere within range to yourself or move a heavy object (like a piece of furniture) about 10 feet (3.5 m). This power lacks the fine control to wield a weapon or move objects with much speed, so in most situations, it's not a means of attack. You can't use this ability on your own body. The power lasts for one hour or until its Might Pool is depleted, whichever comes first. Action. (RR, 81)|
|91â€“92|- **Phase shifting (2 Intellect points):** You can pass slowly through solid barriers at a rate of 1 inch (3 cm) per round (minimum of one round to pass through the barrier). You can't act (other than moving) or perceive anything until you pass entirely through the barrier. You can't pass through energy barriers. Action. (RR, 81)|
|93â€“94|- **Power device (1+ Intellect points):** You can charge an artifact or other device (except a cypher) so that it can be used once. The cost is 1 Intellect point plus 1 point per level of the device. Action. (RR, 81)|
|95â€“96|- **Drain power:** You can drain the power from an artifact or device, allowing you to regain 1 Intellect point per level of the device. You regain points at the rate of 1 point per round and must give your full concentration to the process each round. The GM determines whether the device is fully drained (likely true of most handheld or smaller devices) or retains some power (likely true of large machines). Action to initiate; action each round to drain. (RR, 81)|
|97â€“99|- **Regeneration:** In addition to regaining points through normal recovery rolls, you regain 1 point to your Might Pool or Speed Pool per hour, regardless of whether you rest, until both Pools are at their maximum. Enabler. (RR, 81)|
|00|- **Feed off pain:** Any time a creature within immediate range suffers at least 3 points of damage (after Armor subtraction) in one attack, you can restore 1 point to one of your Pools, up to its maximum. You can feed off any creature in this way, whether friend or foe. You never regain more than 1 point per round. Enabler. (RR, 81)|

#### DISTINCTIVE MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 82)

The following mutations involve dramatic physical changes to the character's appearance. People who have these mutations are always recognized as mutants. Using some of these mutations costs stat Pool points. Some are actions.

Distinctive Mutations

|d100|Distinctive Mutation|
|---|---|
|01â€“02|- **Extra eye:** You have an extra eye on your forehead that you normally keep closed, but you can open it in dim light and see as if in bright light, and see in total darkness as if in very dim light. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|03â€“04|- **Extra mouth:** You have an extra mouth on your hand, face, or stomach. This mouth is filled with razor-sharp teeth and, if used to attack, inflicts 3 points of damage. You can also speak with two voices at once. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|05â€“06|- **Proboscis:** You have a long, moth-like proboscis instead of a mouth. You can speak, but your voice is ever-so-slightly muffled. You take all your nutrition as a liquid, but you can gain sustenance from most plants by inserting the sharp tip of your proboscis into it. You can also feed on the blood of living (or recently living) creatures. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|07â€“09|- **Snakelike arm:** One of your arms ends in a fanged mouth. You can use it to attack, inflicting 3 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack with the arm, you also inject a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). You can't use the snakelike arm for anything other than biting. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|10â€“12|- **Tendrils on forehead:** Four to six tendrils, each 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) long, come out of your forehead. They can grasp and carry anything that your hand could, although a large object would block your field of vision. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|13â€“15|- **Tendrils instead of fingers:** Your fingers are tendrils 1 foot (30 cm) long. They are an asset to any task involving climbing, grasping, or keeping your grip. Further, you can effectively pick up and hold two objects in each hand rather than one. You can't wield more than one weapon per hand. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|16â€“18|- **Tendrils instead of arms:** Your arms are tendrils 6 feet (2 m) long (or only one arm is a tendril, if you prefer). Although you lose the fine manipulative ability of fingers and a thumb, you can still grasp objects, have a much longer reach, and have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|19â€“21|- **Tendrils instead of eyes:** You are blind, but each eye socket has a retractable tendril that is 10 feet (3.5 m) long. These tendrils can feel around rapidly to give you a physical sense of everything within immediate range. Further, they can be used to manipulate very light objects, activate controls, and so forth. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|22â€“24|- **Tendrils instead of legs/feet:** Your legs or feet are tendrils that are 6 feet (2 m) long (or only one leg or foot is a tendril, if you prefer). You can still walk and move normally, and you have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. The tendrils are prehensile enough to grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|25â€“26|- **Roots instead of feet:** If you take a minute to burrow your roots into the ground in conjunction with making a recovery roll, add +2 to the points regained from the roll. You can't move from where you rooted for one minute, even if taking what is normally a one-action recovery roll. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|27â€“29|- **Scaly body:** You gain +2 to Armor. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|30â€“32|- **Shaggy fur:** You gain +1 to Armor (+2 against damage from cold) and have an asset on stealth tasks. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|33â€“35|- **Covered in spiny needles/spikes:** Any creature striking you with its body automatically suffers 1 point of damage. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|36â€“38|- **Quills:** You have quills that you can launch from your body to attack a foe within short range. This attack inflicts 4 points of damage, and you never run out of ammo. You can also use this attack in melee. Action. (RR, 82)|
|39â€“41|- **Carapace:** You gain +2 to Armor. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|42â€“44|- **Mirrored skin:** You gain +2 to Armor against heat, radiation, lasers, and similar attacks. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|45â€“47|- **Chlorophyll:** You gain nutrients from the sun and don't need to eat or breathe if you have daily exposure to sunlight. Your skin, not surprisingly, is green. Enabler. (RR, 82)|
|48â€“50|- **Covered in bursting pods:** Fruit-like pods grow here and there across your entire body. You can walk and move normally. As your action, you can rupture one pod, creating a burst of color, sound, and odor that dazes all creatures within immediate range on their next turn, hindering their tasks. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|51â€“53|- **Extra joint in arms:** Your arms are long and jointed so that you have two elbows in each. You have a long reach and can strike foes from unexpected angles. This mutation is an asset when making melee attacks. However, you can modify your attacks only by using Speed, not Might. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|54â€“56|- **Extra joint in legs:** Your legs are long and jointed so that you have two knees in each. You have a long stride, and this mutation is an asset for all running, climbing, jumping, and balancing tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|57â€“59|- **Rubbery body:** Your bluish-grey body is rubbery through and through. You can act normally and can stretch just your arms to reach things within immediate range that would normally require you to move. You can ignore up to 2 points of falling damage. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|60â€“62|- **Spider legs from torso:** In addition to your normal limbs, six or eight spiderlike legs, each 6 feet (2 m) long, extend from your sides. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, standing your ground, and climbing. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|63â€“65|- **Extra arms:** You have one or two extra arms. They can hold objects, wield weapons, hold a shield, and so on. This mutation does not increase the number of actions you can take in a round or the number of attacks you can attempt. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|66â€“68|- **Extra legs:** You have two extra legs. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, and standing your ground. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|69â€“71|- **Spider legs:** Instead of normal legs, you have a wide torso with six or eight spiderlike legs. They are an asset in any task involving running, keeping your feet, standing your ground, and climbing. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|72â€“74|- **Spider eyes:** Instead of normal eyes, you have a crown of shiny orb-like spider eyes. They provide an asset to initiative and perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|75â€“77|- **Snake tail:** You have a prehensile tail that is 6 feet (2 m) long. It is an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. The tail can grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|78â€“80|- **Snake tail instead of legs:** Instead of legs, you have a snaky tail that is 8 feet (2.5 m) long. You move at the same speed and have an asset for all tasks involving grappling or wrestling. The tail is prehensile enough to grasp large objects. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|81â€“83|- **Stinging tendril:** You have a prehensile tendril (or tail) that grows from some part of your body and ends in a poisonous stinger. You can make an attack with your stinger that inflicts 2 points of damage. If you make a second successful attack roll, the stinger also injects a poison that inflicts 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). The tendril (or tail) can't be used for anything else. Action. (RR, 83)|
|84â€“86|- **Eyes on stalks:** Your eyes are on stalks and can move in any direction, independently of each other. You can peek around corners without exposing yourself to danger. This is an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|87â€“89|- **Extra eyes on hands/fingers:** You can peek around corners without exposing yourself to danger. This is an asset in initiative and all perception tasks. Also roll on the Beneficial Mutations table. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|90â€“93|- **Abnormally large head:** Your head is significantly larger than normal, with a bulging forehead and elongated skull. You gain two assets to any task involving knowledge, memory, lore, understanding, and figuring out puzzles. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|94â€“96|- **Aquatic:** Your body is streamlined and finned, your fingers and toes webbed. You gain two assets in swimming, and you can see perfectly underwater (as if above water). Although you have lungs, you also have gills, so you can breathe underwater. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|97â€“98|- **Wings:** You have feathered or fleshy wings on your back that allow you to glide, carried by the wind. They are not powerful enough to carry you aloft like a bird's wings. Enabler. (RR, 83)|
|99â€“00|- **Cyborg arm:** One of your arms is a bulky organo-metallic arm-like living machine. You can project a ray of burning light from the arm at a target within short range as your action, inflicting 4 points of damage. You have no sense of touch with the arm or hand, so you are hindered when attempting physical tasks with that arm/hand and for tasks that require you to use both hands. Enabler. (RR, 83)|

Mutants aren't just mutated humans. Animals and creatures of all kinds could have mutations in your game setting, as noted under Mutated Creatures, Plants, and NPCs. Very rarely, these mutations could make a nonhuman creature more like a human, with opposable thumbs, greater intelligence, and so on.

#### COSMETIC MUTATIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 84)

Cosmetic mutations affect nothing but the appearance of a character. None are so pronounced as to make a character decidedly more or less attractive. They are simply distinguishing alterations.

## POST-APOCALYPTIC THREATS, HAZARDS, AND GM INTRUSIONS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 85)

**Using the Tables:** Choose or roll randomly when you need a hazard to threaten the PCs. As described under scavenging, attempts to find food, water, useful stuff, or just a safe place to hole up could also require a roll on the table.

### REALISTIC THREATS AND HAZARDS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 86)

Realistic Threats and Hazards

|d100|Threat or Hazard|
|---|---|
|01â€“03|**Blocked road:** The road ahead is so filled with abandoned, rusted before-times vehicles that the PCs must walk if they want to take that route. Walkers are unable to see more than an immediate distance in any direction between the cars. If PCs have a vehicle larger than a bicycle, they'll have to find another way or leave it behind.|
|04â€“06|**Setting-specific element:** Choose a hazard from a set piece or optional rule you're using, or if you want to shake things up, roll on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table. Or just choose the next result on this table.|
|07â€“10|**Angry ants (level 2):** Thousands of biting ants pour from cracks in the pavement, attacking everything in an immediate area, inflicting 2 points of damage if they hit a target and, on a failed Might defense roll, dazing targets with pain for one round. Even if a target succeeds on its initial Speed defense roll, it takes 1 point of damage because the ants are everywhere.|
|11â€“14|**Enraged wasps (level 3):** This wasp swarm acts as a single level 3 creature whose stinging attacks ignore Armor. Attacks on the swarm that don't deal area damage inflict only 1 point of damage.|
|15â€“17|**Cannibal convoy:** A before-times RV pulls up. It's the current property of a group of four to ten people who make the biofuel the vehicle runs on. They seem nice, but they're actually cannibals thinking of inviting the PCs for dinner.|
|18â€“20|**Earthquake, minor (level 3):** The ground within long range of an epicenter heaves and shakes for one or more minutes. Each round, creatures in the area take either 3 points of damage due to the general shaking on a failed Speed defense roll, or 6 points of damage if they are in or adjacent to a structure or terrain feature shedding debris on a failed Speed defense roll.|
|21â€“23|**Radioactive crater (level 3):** Inflicts 3 points of ambient damage per round and moves the character one step down the damage track each day they fail a difficulty 5 Might defense task.|
|24â€“26|**Radioactive storm (level 3):** Treat as a radioactive crater, but one that moves.|
|27â€“29|**Exposed electrical wiring, minor (level 3):** Inflicts 3 points of damage per round of contact, and the character is stunned and unable to take their next action until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Might defense task.|
|30â€“33|**Dilapidated infrastructure, minor (level 3):** The floor gives way beneath a character who falls 30 feet (9 m) on a failed Speed defense roll, taking 3 points of ambient damage and moving one step down the damage track.|
|34â€“40|**Poisoned waters, minor (level 3):** Whether it's water flooding a structure, a stream, a swamp, or a lake, drinking it inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 1 point of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.|
|41â€“48|**Bridge, dangerous (level 4+):** PCs on an overpass, train trestle, or other bridge must make a Speed defense roll as a section gives way beneath their feet, potentially dropping them 40 to 200 feet (12 to 60 m).|
|49â€“53|**Burning structure (level 4):** Everything in or within immediate range of this fire takes 4 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. If PCs can't get away, choking smoke in the area means they must succeed on Might defense rolls each round or suffer 2 points of ambient damage and lose their next action.|
|54â€“57|**Choking pollution (level 4):** Asbestos and other substances once safely bound up in the infrastructure are loose, sometimes as clouds of dangerous particulate matter inflicting 4 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll.|
|58â€“67|**Raider patrol:** Whether on scavenged trucks or motorcycles, or riding mutant pigs bred as war mounts (war pigs), a group of three to six fell riders is bad news.|
|68â€“72|**Avalanche (level 5):** A rumble precedes the falling snow as an avalanche of snow threatens to bury the PCs. (The avalanche could be debris or rubble instead of snow.)|
|73â€“75|**Dilapidated infrastructure, major (level 5):** The building, underpass tunnel, or cave collapses, or the bridge over which the vehicle is passing crumbles. Characters suffer 5 points of damage, and on a failed difficulty 5 Speed task are buried under suffocating rubble until they can escape or are rescued. For additional danger, treat as an unstable structure.|
|76â€“78|**Disease (level 5+):** Even if the world didn't end because of a pandemic, disease threatens the PCs when they meet a group of especially unlucky (and diseased) survivors.|
|79â€“80|**Flooded region (level 5):** A failed Speed defense roll means the rushing waters envelop the character, inflicting 5 points of damage and moving them a short distance in the direction of the water's flow. A serious flood could further endanger the character.|
|81|**Firenado (level 5):** Fire generates a vortex of flame and smoke, creating a rotating column of air that draws in flames and debris, resulting in a powerful whirlwind of fire. The vortex moves an immediate distance (on a roll of 1â€“3 on a d6) or a short distance (on a roll of 4â€“6 on a d6) each round in a random direction, persisting for 1d6 + 2 rounds before dispersing. Anyone intersected by the firenado's immediate-radius area takes 5 points of damage each round on a failed Speed defense roll. The PC must also succeed on a Might defense roll or be pulled up into the firenado, burned for another 5 points of damage, and hurled in a random direction a short distance, which inflicts another 5 points of damage from falling and/or impacting other structures.|
|82â€“84|**Poisoned waters, major (level 5):** Drinking this slightly glowing water inflicts 5 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task, and merely getting wet inflicts 3 points of damage per round for three rounds on a failed Might defense task.|
|85â€“86|**Just a bear, but a big one:** A regular grizzly bear is always frightening, before or after the end.|
|87â€“88|**Nuclear fallout (level 5):** Radioactive dust drifts to the ground or precipitates out as rain. PCs in the area suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute, and if they remain for an hour or longer, they're subject to radiation sickness.|
|89â€“91|**Toxic spill (level 5):** Sticky orange goo bursts from rusted ancient barrels. Characters who fail a defense task are caught and held in place until they can escape the morass, taking 5 points of damage each round they remain stuck.|
|92â€“94|**Unexploded ordnance (level 5):** A buried land mine inflicts 5 points of damage to everything within short range if trod upon or otherwise set off.|
|95â€“97|**Superstorm (level 6):** With the climate destabilized, storms of unprecedented strength sometimes blow, creating winds that inflict 6 points of damage each round targets are exposed.|
|98â€“99|**Radiation, extreme (level 8):** This area was recently hit by a nuclear bomb or other extreme radioactive event, and those in the area for more than a minute who fail a Might defense roll suffer from radiation sickness.|
|00|**Unexploded nuclear warhead (level 10):** If not defused, it could kill everything in a several-mile radius and is likely radioactive to boot.|

- **Grizzly bear:** level 5; health 20; Armor 1
    
- **War pig:** level 3; rider has asset on melee attacks, or pig can make a separate tusk attack when rider attacks
    

### FANTASTIC THREATS AND HAZARDS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 88)

Fantastic Threats and Hazards

|d20|Threat or Hazard|
|---|---|
|1|**Hallucinatory flowers (level 3):** The ground floor of the ruin hosts a handful of purplish flowers growing up out of the rubble. A character who gets a puff of the pollen hallucinates their allies are actually cannibals trying to eat the affected character each round until the character succeeds on a Might defense roll.|
|2|**AI instance, minor (level 3):** An artificial intelligence in an old facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI's goals.|
|3â€“4|**Voracious cockroach swarm (level 3):** This swarm, easily covering an area a short distance in diameter, doesn't shrink from the light or from people. Indeed, it seems eerily intelligent, and if threatened, it attacks, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on everything in its area that fails a Speed defense roll, or 1 point on a successful roll.|
|5|**Animate vegetation (level 4):** Kudzu got a lot worse in the aftermath. Characters that fail a Speed defense roll take 4 points of damage each round from strangulation and vine constriction until they can escape|
|6|**Ashy tide (level 4):** A series of powerful wind gusts in the area kicks up a lot of fine grey ash. Except it's not ashâ€”it's a collection of nanobots, each the size of a grain of sand or smaller, called ashy tide.|
|7â€“8|**Glowing roach infestation:** Four to ten glowing roaches the size of dogs have truly come into their own now that they've grown in stature and intelligence. They have little use for survivors, except as food.|
|9|**Psychic lichen (level 4):** Psychic lichen gently attacks the minds of nearby creatures, causing them to grow tired and nap if they fail an Intellect defense roll. If not awakened, the dozing body serves as food for a new psychic lichen colony.|
|10|**Strike from the heavens (level 4):** A before-times war satellite becomes active and fires a focused microwave beam at the PCs in the area, inflicting 4 points of damage each round they remain in the area without solid cover and fail a Might defense roll, or 2 points on a successful roll.|
|11|**Abomination lair:** The abomination was a person once, or its ancestors were. Not anymore.|
|12|**Fiery fissure (level 5):** A crack splinters the ground along a newly forming fire-filled fissure that stretches a long distance, zigging and zagging to catch several more targets than it might otherwise. PCs who fail a Speed defense roll fall in and are burned for 5 points of damage each round until they can climb out or be pulled out with a successful Might task as an action.|
|13|**Glowing tide (level 5):** Veins of yellow-gold light branching across surfaces (roads, buildings, and bare earth) indicate that nanites are probably active, creating a dangerous area of glowing tide.|
|14|**Time anomaly (level 5):** The PCs encounter a wall of golden light whose interior ripples with lightning. It's a time storm, and either it blocks the PCs' path, or worse, it's gradually sweeping toward the characters.|
|15|**AI instance, major (level 6):** An artificial intelligence in a powered facility attempts to install itself in the wetware (the brain) of humans and any other nearby sapient creatures. Anyone within immediate range of a video screen playing carefully crafted symbols and sounds who fails an Intellect defense roll is stunned, losing their next turn as they stare in rapt attention. If they fail a subsequent defense roll, they come under the control of the AI (because an instance of the AI is running in their head). A target can make a new Intellect defense roll each day to try to reject the control. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI's goals.|
|16|**Hungry tide (level 6):** A greyish-green mist of nanobots a short distance in diameter drifts in the wind, until the hungry tide senses living organisms and moves a short distance each round toward them.|
|17|**Quantum singularity (level 6):** Attempts to change the past to avert the apocalypse have consequences, including these points of unstable space-time. Characters who fail an Intellect defense task are teleported a short distance in a random direction and possibly several hours forward in time.|
|18â€“19|**Rampaging wardroid (level 6):** Wardroids may be what caused the apocalypse in the first place; whatever the case, one has wandered directly into the PCs' path.|
|20|**Mutant bear:** The house-sized radioactive bear, whose roar can be heard for miles, is something to avoid.|

### GM INTRUSIONS FOR POST-APOCALYPTIC GAMES

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 90)

If you're running a game set in the ruins following civilization's fall, refer to the following list of unexpected complications to your PCs' day. GM intrusions can happen anytime, whether the PCs think they're safe in a defended settlement or recently secured shelter, or traveling across the wasteland.

Select a GM intrusion appropriate to the situation, roll one randomly, or use the list to inspire an intrusion of your own.

GM Intrusions for Post-Apocalyptic Games

|d100|Target|Threat or Hazard|
|---|---|---|
|01â€“02|Group|Roll on the preceding Realistic Threats and Hazards table, or on the Fantastic Threats and Hazards table if your game includes fantastic elements.|
|03â€“04|Character|The character is surprised by a diseased feral cat, which bites them and runs off, infecting the PC with a level 4 disease that drops them one step on the damage track each day they fail a Might defense roll.|
|05â€“06|Group or Character|The PCs' mode of transport breaks (or someone's boot heel snaps off), requiring about an hour of repair, possibly meaning that they have to duck into nearby ruins to find parts.|
|07â€“08|Character|A weirdly gnarled hand emerges from the ground or ruin, grabs the character, and pulls them down into an ancient bunker containing a zombie hulk.|
|09â€“10|Group|The PCs discover their food and water supplies have become contaminated with poisonous mold or dangerous levels of radiation (level 4).|
|11â€“12|Group|An unseasonal blizzard forces the PCs to seek shelter in an abandoned train yard, which shows signs of being claimed by another group of survivors.|
|13â€“14|Character|The character treads on a sticky slurry of ooze leaking from a ruined factory that holds them in place unless they give up their footwear and/or succeed on a difficulty 5 Might task to pull free.|
|15â€“16|Character|A radioactive spider bites the character, inflicting 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor), and on a failed difficulty 3 Might defense roll, the character develops one harmful mutation. Each day the PC can attempt another Might defense roll; with a success, the mutation subsides.|
|17â€“18|Group|A wildfire or structural fire (level 5) moves through the area; PCs must run before it to survive. However, when the fire has burnt out several hours later, the PCs are lost.|
|19â€“20|Group|A sinkhole opens beneath the PCs' vehicle, which becomes hopelessly stuck in loose earth until they can succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to push it out. If PCs don't have a vehicle, the sinkhole sucks down one character and threatens to smother them unless the others succeed on a difficulty 7 Might roll to extract them.|
|21â€“22|Character|The PC discovers they are infested with mutant green lice (level 5); Might tasks (including defense rolls) are hindered until the PC is treated with appropriate cleansing chemicals.|
|23â€“24|Group|High winds, acidic precipitation, or a drift of grey goo eats through the PCs' shelter's roof.|
|25â€“26|Character|The character wakes to discover that some of their equipment has been pilfered, but the PC on watch didn't see anything (and isn't responsible for the theft). Investigation reveals that weirdly smart termites (level 4) working together made off with the item.|
|27â€“28|Group|Yellow mushrooms with black speckles (level 4) grow profusely in the area and ooze weirdly blood-like fluid when brushed or trod upon, or simply as PCs pass by. The mushrooms are poisonous, inflicting 4 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) if ingested, but they also grant PCs a one-time asset on any knowledge tasks they attempt during the next ten hours.|
|29â€“30|Group|That buzzing noise that's been getting louder and louder is revealed as a swarm of aggressive, stinging radioactive bees.|
|31â€“32|Group|The PCs enter a region threatened by pockets of explosive gas (level 5), visible before they detonate as low-lying banks of thin, yellowish mist. If agitated, a gas pocket detonates, inflicting 5 points of damage on everything in the area, or 2 points on PCs who succeed on a Speed defense roll.|
|33â€“34|Character|The character trips or is thrown from their vehicle or mount by a jolt or similar accidental incident, risking a broken bone on a failed difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.|
|35â€“36|Group|A before-times radio transmission is received, asking anyone, anywhere, for aid.|
|37â€“38|Group|Mosquitos the size of hummingbirds attack.|
|39â€“40|Character|The character steps in a bear trap left by other survivors. The PC takes 6 points of damage and is caught in a painful clamp until an ally succeeds on a difficulty 6 Might task to remove it.|
|41â€“42|Character|The character stumbles over a decaying human corpse apparently killed by invasive fungus (level 3) eating through their brain.|
|43â€“44|Character|The character ate something that didn't agree with them, and becomes so afflicted with nausea that their tasks, attacks, and defense rolls are hindered by two steps for the next few hours.|
|45â€“46|Group|A mushroom cloud from a nuclear detonation blooms on the horizon. Are the PCs far enough away to survive? Maybe, if they find shelter pronto.|
|47â€“48|Character|A mutated animal with unhealthy skin lesions and bulbous growths (with giant rat stats) scurries from the character's backpack or other container when they stow or retrieve equipment. The animal runs off unless attacked, in which case it fights to the death.|
|49â€“50|Group|The PCs encounter a survivor claiming to be looking for a source of water that's not radioactive. Maybe they're telling the truth and could use some help. Or maybe they're a spy from a nearby raider camp.|
|51â€“52|Character|The thin trickle of water running through the ruins must be intermittently in contact with live electrical wires, as the character discovers when they take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and are stunned, losing their next turn.|
|53â€“54|Character|A lurking rattlesnake bites the PC, then slithers off.|
|55â€“56|Group|When the PCs return to their camp or place of refuge, they find that someone else has stolen all their carefully hoarded stores and wrecked part of the camp.|
|57â€“58|Group|A pack of seven rabid dogs appears, growling and snarling.|
|59â€“60|Character|The character falls partly (or completely) through the rotting floor, trapping their foot until they succeed on a difficulty 4 Might roll, or dropping them to a lower floor (and separating them from the others).|
|61â€“62|Group|It's hot outside today, due to a combination of aberrant weather conditions. PCs without some means of cooling themselves off suffer 1 point of ambient damage each minute in the "heat dome" covering the region.|
|63â€“64|Group|Eroded earth and dead vegetation in the region create perfect conditions for a sandstorm, which blows through the area for several hours, reducing visibility to an immediate distance.|
|65â€“66|Group|An electromagnetic storm rips through the area, knocking out any electronic devices the PCs might have, and potentially threatening PCs without shelter with a lightning strike (level 7).|
|67â€“68|Character|An automatic defense system comes back online as PCs pass, deploying a metal-clad pop-up turret (level 5). Each minute, it targets the character with a mini-missile attack that inflicts 10 points of damage (or 3 points even with a successful Speed defense roll).|
|69â€“70|Group|A group of three to six zombies (or cannibals, if your game has no zombies) stumbles out of the hospital, bunker, or old military facility.|
|71â€“72|Character|The character's trusty weapon finally rusts through or otherwise breaks.|
|73â€“74|Group|Seeping gas (level 4) in the area causes the PCs to begin hallucinating. Each is certain the other is some kind of threatâ€”such as a raider, a zombie, or something else dangerousâ€”until they succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect defense roll on their turn to realize what's going on.|
|75â€“76|Group|The characters are caught in a stampede of rewilded giraffes, elephants, buffalo, or other large animals. Each PC suffers 3 points of damage, descends one step on the damage track, and on a failed difficulty 3 Speed defense roll, is borne along for a while and separated from their allies.|
|77â€“78|Group|The heavy rain and lightning storm suddenly births a tornado. PCs must seek shelter or suffer 7 points of damage each round they are exposed. If a PC takes enough damage to descend three steps on the damage track, they are pulled up into the vortex and lost.|
|79â€“80|Character|The character discovers they've started growing a sixth finger on their left hand. Why? Maybe due to their previous exposures to whatever mutagen exists in the world, or for a reason yet to be learned.|
|81â€“82|Group|A before-times jet appears in the sky, engines spewing smoke, before it crashes close enough to deal 4 points of damage to PCs that fail a difficulty 4 Speed defense roll.|
|83â€“84|Group|It begins to hail ice chunks the size of golf balls, inflicting 3 points of damage each round on PCs without shelter. The event also knocks any exposed vehicles or shelter the PCs rely on one step down the object damage track.|
|85â€“86|Character|The character steps on a plant that releases spores blinding them for about a minute.|
|87â€“88|Character|The character walks through a hidden trip wire set by other survivors, causing an alarm to blare.|
|89â€“90|Group|A group of people (level 2) with glazed eyes appear with gifts of food. They want to introduce the PCs to their AI benefactor (or warlord, if your game has no AIs) via an old-time communications device they have with them.|
|91â€“92|Character|The character has been pushing too hard and they're exhausted; they move down one step on the damage track until after their next ten-hour recovery.|
|93â€“94|Character|Through misadventure, the character falls from the vehicle or mount, and no one else immediately notices.|
|95â€“96|Character|A mutant skunk with two heads (or regular skunk, if your game doesn't feature mutations) sprays the character. The character's pleasant social interaction tasks are hindered by two steps for two to five days.|
|97â€“98|Group|NPC survivors demand PCs pay a toll to pass, equal to enough food and water to sustain one person for five days.|
|99â€“00|Group|The PCs arrive, but apparently their directions were wrong, because they're not where they wanted to go, but someplace completely different.|

- **Radioactive bees, swarm:** level 5; stings inflict 6 damage and, on failed Might defense roll, an allergic reaction dealing 1 Speed damage (ignores Armor) each minute until target is tended
    
- **Mosquitos, giant, swarm:** level 3; bite inflicts damage and, on failed Might defense roll, target contracts Nipah
    
- **Rabid dog:** level 3, attacks as level 4; Armor 1
    

**Editor's Notes â€”** Nipah (RR, 38) is Level 5 disease.

## POST APOCALYPTIC CYPHERS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 131)

- **Subtle Cyphers:** Subtle cyphers are appropriate if your game's pre-apocalyptic world was realistic (like our modern world) right up until it was destroyed and if the disaster was a realistic cataclysm (like a pandemic, climate disaster, or war).
    
- **Manifest Cyphers:** Manifest cyphers in a post-apocalyptic game might be remnants of the technology or magic that civilization used before it fell, or the technology or magic that caused the end of the world.
    

### SCAVENGER SUBTLE CYPHERS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 132)

Resource scarcity, including lack of water and food, threatens PCs in most post-apocalyptic settings. Enter scavenger subtle cyphers. These give PCs one more way to find useful stuff like edible food, clean water, a helpful tool, extra ammo, or other needful things.

Discovering Scavenger Subtle Cyphers

 

Anytime PCs in your game are eligible for discovering a subtle cypher, consider giving someone in the group a scavenger subtle cypher. No more than one PC in the group should have a scavenger subtle cypher at any given time. Once they use it, you can give another PC in the group one, preferably something different.

Using a Scavenger Subtle Cypher

 

The character uses their action to activate the scavenger subtle cypher, as usual. At the end of their turn, they gain the indicated resource.

Scavenger Subtle Cyphers

|d20|Scavenger Subtle Cyphers|
|---|---|
|1â€“2|Ammunition|
|3â€“4|Construction supply|
|5â€“6|Edible food|
|7|Firearm|
|8â€“9|First aid|
|10â€“11|How-to manual|
|12|Medicine|
|13â€“14|Melee weapon|
|15|Potable liquid|
|16|Transport|
|17|Useful clothing|
|18|Useful thing|
|19â€“20|Useful tool|

**Editor's Notes â€”** Scavenger subtle cyphers are a good match for the Transferring Subtle Cyphers optional rule.

### AI-FASHIONED MANIFEST CYPHERS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 136)

Another variety of cyphers PCs might discover are AI-fashioned. When activated, the cypher dematerializes, swirling out into a cloud of free-floating tiny machines that create the cypher's effect through direct manipulation before burning out or dispersing.

AI-fashioned cyphers can provide nearly any effect described for cyphers in the cypher tables in Chapter 24: : Cyphers, as well as the effects described for the new manifest cyphers in the following section.

Secondary Effect

 

Any time an AI-fashioned manifest cypher is used, there's a chance the AI who created it for their own ambiguous purpose becomes aware, if that instance still operates somewhere. That usually has no bearing on the situation, but if the PC triggers an intrusion while using the cypher, a fledgling instance of the AI tries to install on the PC, who must succeed on an Intellect defense roll against the cypher's level to avoid coming under the control of the AI for one minute, or until they succeed on an Intellect defense roll on their turn. A PC under AI control might stand and do nothing, fall mysteriously unconscious, or take an action to advance the AI's goals.

AI-Fashioned Manifest Cyphers

|d10|AI-Fashioned Manifest Cyphers|
|---|---|
|1|AI instance|
|2|Armor breach|
|3|Data wipe|
|4|Denature nanotech|
|5|Detonation (prion)|
|6|Disassembler|
|7|Disassembler, ephemeral|
|8|Fabricator, civil|
|9|Fabricator, military|
|10|Smartdust|

### A LISTING OF POST-APOCALYPTIC CYPHERS

#### AI INSTANCE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** Installs an AI instance in an inert object. The instance persists for about a day. The AI's level is equal to this cypher's level. The AI has the ability to understand and audibly synthesize nearly any language and can provide answers to questions. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the higher its level. The instance can only answer questions equal to its level or less. Generally, knowledge that could be found by looking somewhere other than the current location is level 1 or higher, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. Gaining knowledge of the future is impossible. If the AI answers a question of level 5 or higher, the instance's existence terminates. Alternatively, the AI can be used to engage another AI in the area, distracting it from taking direct actions for a number of minutes equal to this cypher's level. After this interval, the instance's existence terminates.
    

#### AMMUNITION

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** The character gains ten shells or bullets suitable for a firearm owned by someone in the group. If no one has a firearm, ten shotgun shells are found. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, thirty shells or bullets are found.
    

#### ARMOR BREACH

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** A successfully targeted creature or object within short range becomes coated with a clinging film of nanotech for one minute. While coated, a creature has 2 less Armor than usual (3 less if the cypher is level 5 or 6). While coated, an object temporarily moves one step down the object damage track (or two steps down if the cypher is level 5 or 6).
    

#### CONSTRUCTION SUPPLY

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. The right component or substance for the job provides an asset to related tasks.
    

Construction Supply

|d6|Component or Substance|
|---|---|
|1|Glue, wood, ceramic, or super|
|2|Epoxy, metal welding|
|3|Nails, screws, fasteners|
|4|Electrician's tape|
|5â€“6|Duct tape|

#### DATA WIPE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** A successfully targeted AI instance within short range whose level is equal to or less than this cypher's level is suppressed and unable to function for one minute. If this cypher's level is 7 or higher, a success means the instance is permanently wiped from the hardware (or wetware, if installed on a living creature).
    

#### DENATURE NANOTECH

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** Coats a short area surrounding the user, or adjacent to the user, with a nearly invisible film of nanotech that lasts for years. The first time anyone attempts to use a nanotech-based cypher, ability, or other effect in the affected area whose level is less than this cypher's level, that use is suppressed and fails. Once one effect is suppressed, the denaturing effect is expended. The cypher instead can be used to end one ongoing nanotech effect of the cypher's level or less in a short area, but the user must succeed on an Intellect attack roll against the level of the effect or the target creating the effect. For instance, if this cypher is successfully used against a creature genetically engineered by nanotech, the creature would become so much inert biological matter.
    

#### DETONATION (PRION)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** Projects a small physical explosive up to a long distance away that bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level. On a hit, the living tissue of targets whose level is less than the cypher's level begins to unravel due to a prion-unfolding chain reaction. These targets take damage equal to the cypher's level on the first round, then 1 point of damage each subsequent round until only so much cloudy pink fluid remains. PCs can make a Might defense roll each round to end the effect; two successful defense rolls end the chain reaction. NPCs whose level is equal to or higher than the cypher's level take damage from the cypher for only one round.
    

#### DISASSEMBLER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** Recycles waste or other unwanted material by breaking it down to constituent atoms and molecules. If used destructively, this cypher can disassemble an object within immediate range whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's level that fits into a 10-foot (3.5 m) cube, or it can create a cavity of the same volume in a larger object whose level is less than the cypher's level. If used as a weapon against creatures, the cypher can be hurled a short distance like a detonation, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level in an immediate area and reducing the effectiveness of any Armor worn by targets by 1.
    

#### DISASSEMBLER, EPHEMERAL

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** An object or creature whose level is equal to or less than this cypher's level within immediate range is temporarily disassembled into its component atoms and molecules. The disassembly lasts for up to ten hours or until a time specified by the user, whichever occurs first. When the effect ends, the object or creature is reassembled over the course of one round at the location where it was disassembled (or at the location the fine "dust" of its disassembly was moved to). A Speed attack roll is necessary to affect an unwilling target. PCs can make a Might defense roll to resist being disassembled.
    

#### EDIBLE FOOD

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. Food obtained is enough to feed one adult for one day, or if coffee is discovered, about a gallon (4 L).
    

Edible Food

|d100|Food|
|---|---|
|01â€“03|Baby food, jarred|
|04â€“06|Beans, canned|
|07â€“08|Beans, dehydrated|
|09â€“12|Bouillon cubes|
|13â€“14|Canned pasta|
|15â€“16|Cereal, breakfast|
|17â€“18|Cheese in wax|
|19â€“20|Chocolate, dark|
|21â€“22|Coffee, instant|
|23|Eggs, fresh|
|24|Eggs, powdered|
|25â€“26|Energy bar|
|27â€“28|Fruit, canned|
|29â€“30|Fruit, dried|
|31â€“34|Fruit, fresh|
|35â€“40|Honey|
|41â€“42|Mayonnaise|
|43â€“44|Meat, canned|
|45â€“47|Milk, powdered|
|48â€“50|Nuts|
|51â€“53|Oatmeal|
|54â€“56|Pasta, dried|
|57â€“58|Pet food, canned|
|59â€“62|Rice, dried|
|63â€“72|Snack bag, dried chips, candy, _etc._|
|73â€“83|Sugar, bulk|
|84â€“97|Vegetables, canned|
|98â€“00|Vegetables, fresh|

#### FABRICATOR, CIVIL

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** Assembles a specified object whose level is equal to the cypher's level. Once created, the object is permanent until destroyed. A civil fabricator can build one object on the Additional Post-Apocalyptic Equipment table (or another equipment table in the Cypher System Rulebook) that falls into the "other items" categoryâ€”no weapons or armor. The user chooses which item to fabricate by speaking aloud the name of the item they want as they activate the cypher. The higher the cypher level, the more expensive an item the fabricator can create, as follows: Level 2 cyphers can fabricate inexpensive items, cyphers of level 3 or less can fab inexpensive and moderately priced items, cyphers of level 6 or less can fab up to expensive items, and level 7 cyphers can fab up to very expensive items.
    
    A civil fabricator can create appropriately priced food items. However, it can't fabricate living creatures.
    

**Editor's Notes â€”** In the description of the Civil Fabricator cypher's levels and price categories, "or less" is probably a typo and should read "or higher".

#### FABRICATOR, MILITARY

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 138)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** A military fabricator cypher functions like a civil fabricator; however, it can be used to create armor or weapons. If a weapon that uses ammunition is fabricated, the weapon's magazine holds up to ten rounds of fabbed ammunition.
    

#### FIREARM

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 134)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. A firearm is usually found with about ten bullets or shells (or crossbow bolts). The discovered firearm works, but it is damaged and has a GM intrusion range of 1â€“3 on a d20. In addition to any other effect of a GM intrusion, the firearm breaks (but could be repaired).
    

Firearm

|d10|Specific firearm|
|---|---|
|1|Handgun (light, short range)|
|2|Light crossbow (medium, long range)|
|3|Handgun (medium, long range)|
|4|Heavy crossbow (heavy, long range)|
|5|Rifle (medium, long range)|
|6|Shotgun (heavy, immediate range)|
|7|Handgun, big (heavy, long range)|
|8|Assault rifle (heavy, rapid-fire, long range)|
|9|Heavy rifle (heavy, very long range)|
|10|Submachine gun (medium, rapid-fire, short range)|

#### FIRST AID

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 134)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** The character gains a fully stocked first aid kit. The kit provides an asset for one healing task. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, it provides assets for four healing tasks before it is exhausted.
    

#### HOW-TO MANUAL

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 134)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. If the manual is studied for about an hour, the character gains an asset to a related knowledge task.
    

How-to Manual

|d10|Topics|
|---|---|
|1|Plumbing|
|2|Electronics|
|3|Gardening|
|4|Farming|
|5|Civil engineering|
|6|Robotics|
|7|Health|
|8|Renewables (solar, wind)|
|9|Smithcraft|
|10|Chemistry|

#### MEDICINE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 134)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain. The right medicine vanquishes (or treats the symptoms of) an eligible disease or illness. Other medicines are preventative.
    
- **Special:** A character who suffers from one of these medical conditions, without treatment, descends one step on the damage track every month or so.
    

Medicine

#### MELEE WEAPON

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 135)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** One of the following items is gained; roll randomly. If the cypher's level is 6 or higher, the character can choose which item they obtain.

## PRE-APOCALYPTIC ARTIFACTS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 138)

One interesting approach for artifacts in a post-apocalyptic setting is to use before-times items that were once commonplaceâ€”such as books, functioning vehicles, and portable water filters, among many other itemsâ€”but are now nearly impossible to manufacture and hard to preserve. The depletion roll for such items represents the likelihood that the item will fall apart, break down, or run out. The upshot of adopting such a system for your game is that nearly every nonfood item on the Useful Stuff table is also a pre-apocalyptic artifact. Give most of these items a depletion of 1 in 1d20; however, if the item seems particularly hardy, a roll of 1d100 is appropriate. If particularly flimsy or prone to being used up, a depletion of 1d10 or 1d6 would be in order. Refer to the following examples as a guide for adapting before-times Useful Stuff objects into artifacts with a specific depletion.

### BOOK

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 138)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Textbook, how-to book, or other nonfiction book of knowledge on one topic; may be moldy or otherwise damaged

- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### FARADAY CAGE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 138)

- **Level:** 3

## POST APOCALYPTIC ARTIFACTS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 139)

Artifacts in a post-apocalyptic game include still-working technology from before the disaster that is not widely available, as well as cobbled-together pieces of tech that can weaponize previously prosaic items. If the apocalypse was related to some kind of alien invasion, artifacts would include even stranger items.

Some of the post-apocalyptic artifacts described here are, for the most part, retro-futuristicâ€”created by super-science that is mostly beyond today's technology. Most of these would fit in almost any post-apocalyptic setting that includes fantastic elements, especially if reskinned to be thematically appropriate. The artifacts presented below include artifacts appropriate to an End Times apocalypse, an apocalypse caused by the rise of antagonistic AIs, and alien tech possibly brought by invading or terraforming aliens. That said, any artifact could potentially be the result of AI artifice. Such artifacts usually have a fractal quality to their form, as is the case for AI-fashioned cyphers. And like AI-fashioned cyphers, a triggered intrusion could endanger the user if an instance of the artificial intelligence that created the item tries to install itself on the PC's wetware (mind).

Post-Apocalyptic Artifacts

|d20|Apocalypse|Artifact|
|---|---|---|
|1â€“2|Retro-futuristic|Autodoc|
|3â€“4|Alien|Carbonizer|
|5â€“6|Retro-futuristic|Enviroscanner|
|7|Alien or AI-fashioned|Memory Eraser|
|8|Retro-futuristic|Military exoskeleton|
|9|AI-fashioned|Mutation Inducer|
|10â€“12|AI-fashioned|Nanorifle|
|13|Retro-futuristic|Rocket first|
|14â€“16|Retro-futuristic|Rocket-propelled grenade|
|17|End Times|Seal of Solomon|
|18|End Times|Spear of Destiny|
|19|Retro-futuristic|Terahertz scanner|
|20|Alien|Transfer discs|

### AUTODOC

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Backpack-sized plastic module from which clamps, forceps, scalpels, and needles can extend
    
- **Effect:** When strapped to a target (or when someone wearing the autodoc is damaged), the autodoc activates and restores 1 point to a target's Pools each round for ten rounds or until the target is fully healed, whichever happens first.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### CARBONIZER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 139)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Tiny silver device with multiple prong-like barrels
    
- **Effect:** This weapon fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level that ignores Armor (including Armor granted by force fields). A target killed by a carbonizer is turned completely to dust.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### ENVIROSCANNER

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Forearm-mounted computer tablet
    
- **Effect:** This multifunction device can receive radio transmissions, automatically map locations the wearer has visited, play various forms of media, keep voice and written records, and provide an asset to any task related to interfacing with other computerized systems or machines. Also, the wearer can scan for specific materials, toxic traces, and life forms within short range.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (check per use of scanning function)
    

### MEMORY ERASER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 139)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Handheld reflective mass
    
- **Effect:** A flash of nano-textured light erases the last few minutes of memory in all creatures within immediate range that the user makes a successful Intellect attack on (one attack roll per target).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### MILITARY EXOSKELETON

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Articulated metal struts with deformable padding and straps for custom fit to a human frame
    
- **Effect:** For one hour per use (when the exoskeleton is powered on), the wearer has +1 to their Speed Edge and +1 to their Might Edge.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### MUTATION INDUCER

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 139)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Handheld reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures
    
- **Effect:** A targeted willing or helpless creature within immediate range is transformed over the course of one minute, gaining a randomly determined beneficial mutation. If the artifact is level 6 or higher, the target instead gains a powerful mutation. Mutations gained by the inducer fade within about a day.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (upon depletion, target also gains a harmful mutation)
    

### NANORIFLE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 140)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Sleek two-handed reflective device with gradually evolving fractal textures
    
- **Effect:** This weapon contains an onboard AI that assists the user, granting an asset to any attacks made with the weapon. The weapon fires a stream of nanomachine rounds at a target within long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level. In addition, if the target fails an Intellect defense roll, they are affected as if with a minor AI instance hazard, coming under the control of the AI housed in the nanorifle rather than a random artificial intelligence. The AI usually works with the user to exert control over the target. Control lasts for about a minute.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### ROCKET FIST

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Metal gauntlet with flaring rocket exhaust nozzles
    
- **Effect:** If the user activates the fist as part of an attack, the punch gains a rocket assist. If the attack is successful, the fist inflicts additional damage equal to the artifact level and throws the target back a short distance.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10

- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

### SEAL OF SOLOMON

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 140)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Signet ring bearing a star design
    
- **Effect:** The wearer can attempt to command a demon, a devil, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, an angel, or a similar entity by making a successful Intellect attack roll against a target within short range. An affected target must do as requested for up to one minute (if the creature is level 5 or lower) or for one round (if the creature is level 6 or higher). The ring also grants the wearer the ability to understand and communicate with animals.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### SPEAR OF DESTINY

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 140)

- **Level:** 7
    
- **Form:** Heavy spear of ancient manufacture
    
- **Effect:** Attacks with this spear are eased. If used against a supernatural creature such as a demon, a Horseman of the Apocalypse, or an angel, it ignores Armor, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (10 points total). If an attack with the spear kills a target normally able to return to existence (such as a Horseman), the target is truly destroyed instead.
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

**Spear of Destiny GM intrusion:** The wielder's heart is not pure enough to permit the use of the spear, and it burns the character for 7 points of ambient damage each round they use it.

### TERAHERTZ SCANNER

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 300)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Visor fitted with bulky electronics
    
- **Effect:** By emitting terahertz and long-range infrared light, this device allows a user to see a short distance through most interior walls of standard structures, through normal clothing, and into normal bags and briefcases. Only stone or concrete more than 6 inches (15 cm) thick prevents a scan. Regardless, images are black and white and fuzzy, and lack fine detail.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### TRANSFER DISCS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 140)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Two or more matching discs 3 feet (1 m) in diameter
    
- **Effect:** The user can step between deployed transfer discs, teleporting any distance. If a series of discs is deployed in a network, the user receives a mental map of the discs upon stepping on any one of them, and they can navigate by stepping on each intervening disc between their current location and their desired location. To deploy a disc as their action, the user places it on a mostly level, secure surface and must succeed on a difficulty 3 Intellect-based roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check after each day of use)

## POST-APOCALYPTIC CREATURES AND NPCS

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 93)

Those that survived the cataclysm are tougher, or at least luckier. Here are a couple of methods for creating even more creatures and NPCs for your post-apocalyptic setting than the ones that appear here and in Chapter 22: : Creatures and Chapter 23: NPCs.

- **Reskin:** One way to create new creatures appropriate for your setting is to grab one from any other [Cypher System bestiary](https://www.montecookgames.com/cypher-system-creature-search/) and change its description just enough so it works in your game.
    
- **Blighted:** Another approach is to apply the Blighted "template" to a regular animal, creature, or person, turning them into a more twisted version of their pre-apocalypse self.
    

### CREATURES BY APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

#### ANY APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

Almost any apocalypse will include natural wildlife, like bears, dogs, and rats, as well as various human survivors. Some of those human survivors will become bandits, fell riders, marauders, a few warlords, and probably some cannibals. A few could stalk the wasteland as bounty-hunting (or revenge-seeking) assassins.

#### BIBLICAL APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

In addition to creatures common to any apocalypse, a biblical apocalypse should also include fallen angels, angels, demons, and devils, and of course the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Beast, Sword, Famine, and Plague).

#### NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

Besides creatures common to any apocalypse, it's possible PCs could run into various radioactive creatures such as fusion hounds, glowing roaches, gamma worms, and radioactive bears, as well as a variety of creatures with the Blighted template.

#### AI APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

Besides creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse, PCs might encounter CRAZRs (318), hooked blossoms, vat rejects, mechanical soldiers, wardroids, and zhev (370). And, of course, a few instances of artificial intelligence, possibly including AI zombies.

#### ALIEN APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

If the world is invaded or terraformed by aliens, creatures and NPCs common to any apocalypse exist, as well as the potential for various aliens such as greys, slidikin (354), enthrallers, and maybe even a kaiju or two.

#### TEMPORAL APOCALYPSE

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 95)

If the barriers between time, space, and dimension break down, ushering in a time rip, any creature and NPC from any genre could be encountered, including supervillains, chronophages, kaiju, killer clowns, killing white lights, and melted.

### BASIC CREATURES AND NPCS FOR A POST-APOCALYPTIC GAME

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 299)

- **Crazy loner:** level 3, deception and attacks as level 5
    
- **Gamma snake:** level 4; bite inflicts 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor)
    
- **Innocuous rodent:** level 1
    
- **Mongrel dog:** level 4
    
- **Survivor, sickened:** level 3, interaction and knowledge tasks as level 1; carries level 4 infectious disease
    
- **Survivor, typical:** level 3
