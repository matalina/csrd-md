This chapter explains how to create characters to play in a Cypher System game. This involves a series of decisions that will shape your character, so the more you understand what kind of character you want to play, the easier character creation will be. The process involves understanding the values of three game statistics and choosing three aspects that determine your character's capabilities.

---

## CHARACTER STATS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 14)

Every player character has three defining characteristics, which are typically called "statistics" or "stats." These stats are Might, Speed, and Intellect. They are broad categories that cover many different but related aspects of a character.

### MIGHT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 14)

Might defines how strong and durable your character is. The concepts of strength, endurance, constitution, hardiness, and physical prowess are all folded into this one stat. Might isn't relative to size; instead, it's an absolute measurement. An elephant has more Might than the mightiest tiger, which has more Might than the mightiest rat, which has more Might than the mightiest spider.

Might governs actions from forcing doors open to walking for days without food to resisting disease. It's also the primary means of determining how much damage your character can sustain in a dangerous situation. Physical characters, tough characters, and characters interested in fighting should focus on Might.

Might could be thought of as Might/Health because it governs how strong you are and how much physical punishment you can take.

### SPEED

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 14)

Speed describes how fast and physically coordinated your character is. The stat embodies quickness, movement, dexterity, and reflexes. Speed governs such divergent actions as dodging attacks, sneaking around quietly, and throwing a ball accurately. It helps determine whether you can move farther on your turn. Nimble, fast, or sneaky characters will want good Speed stats, as will those interested in ranged combat.

Speed could be thought of as Speed/Agility because it governs your overall swiftness and reflexes.

### INTELLECT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 14)

This stat determines how smart, knowledgeable, and likable your character is. It includes intelligence, wisdom, charisma, education, reasoning, wit, willpower, and charm. Intellect governs solving puzzles, remembering facts, telling convincing lies, and using mental powers. Characters interested in communicating effectively, being learned scholars, or wielding supernatural powers should stress their Intellect stat.

Intellect could be thought of as Intellect/Personality because it governs both intelligence and charisma.

### DEFENSE TASKS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 23)

Defense tasks are when a player makes a roll to keep something undesirable from happening to their PC. The type of defense task matters when using Effort.

- **Might defense:** Used for resisting poison, disease, and anything else that can be overcome with strength and health.
    
- **Speed defense:** Used for dodging attacks and escaping danger. This is by far the most commonly used defense task.
    
- **Intellect defense:** Used for fending off mental attacks or anything that might affect or influence one's mind.
    

---

## POOL, EDGE, AND EFFORT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 15)

Each of the three stats has two components: Pool and Edge. Your Pool represents your raw, innate ability, and your Edge represents knowing how to use what you have. A third element ties into this concept: Effort. When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you apply Effort.

Your stat Pools, as well as your Effort and Edge, are determined by the character type, descriptor, and focus that you choose. Within those guidelines, however, you have a lot of flexibility in how you develop your character.

### POOL

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 15)

Your Pool is the most basic measurement of a stat. Comparing the Pools of two creatures will give you a general sense of which creature is superior in that stat. For example, a character who has a Might Pool of 16 is stronger (in a basic sense) than a character who has a Might Pool of 12. Most characters start with a Pool of 9 to 12 in most stats—that's the average range.

When your character is injured, sickened, or attacked, you temporarily lose points from one of your stat Pools. The nature of the attack determines which Pool loses points. For example, physical damage from a sword reduces your Might Pool, a poison that makes you clumsy reduces your Speed Pool, and a psionic blast reduces your Intellect Pool. You can also spend points from one of your stat Pools to decrease a task's difficulty (see Effort, below). You can rest to recover lost points from a stat Pool, and some special abilities or cyphers might allow you to recover lost points quickly.

**Editor's Notes —** One way to think about your stat Pools is a well of stamina, potential, and efficacy. The remaining points in your Pools are what you have left to give by using special abilities with costs, or applying Effort. You can increase your stat Pools through character advancement and special abilities like Enhanced Might, Enhanced Speed, and Enhanced Intellect.

### EDGE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 15)

Although your Pool is the basic measurement of a stat, your Edge is also important. When something requires you to spend points from a stat Pool, your Edge for that stat reduces the cost. It also reduces the cost of applying Effort to a roll.

For example, let's say you have a mental blast ability, and activating it costs 1 point from your Intellect Pool. Subtract your Intellect Edge from the activation cost, and the result is how many points you must spend to use the mental blast. If using your Edge reduces the cost to 0, you can use the ability for free.

Your Edge can be different for each stat. For example, you could have a Might Edge of 1, a Speed Edge of 1, and an Intellect Edge of 0. You'll always have an Edge of at least 1 in one stat. Your Edge for a stat reduces the cost of spending points from that stat Pool, but not from other Pools. Your Might Edge reduces the cost of spending points from your Might Pool, but it doesn't affect your Speed Pool or Intellect Pool. Once a stat's Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort for free.

A character who has a low Might Pool but a high Might Edge has the potential to perform Might actions consistently better than a character who has a Might Edge of 0. The high Edge will let them reduce the cost of spending points from the Pool, which means they'll have more points available to spend on applying Effort.

**Editor's Notes —** One way to think about Edge is "effortlessness" or "efficiency"—Edge represents what a PC can accomplish with a stat without having to try very hard or spend points from a stat Pool. You can increase your Edge through character advancement and special abilities like Enhanced Might Edge, Enhanced Speed Edge, and Enhanced Intellect Edge. For more on Edge, see Clarification: Effort and Edge.

### EFFORT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 15)

When your character really needs to accomplish a task, you can apply Effort. For a beginning character, applying Effort requires spending 3 points from the stat Pool appropriate to the action. Thus, if your character tries to dodge an attack (a Speed roll) and wants to increase the chance for success, you can apply Effort by spending 3 points from your Speed Pool. Effort eases the task by one step. This is called applying one level of Effort.

You don't have to apply Effort if you don't want to. If you choose to apply Effort to a task, you must do it before you attempt the roll—you can't roll first and then decide to apply Effort if you rolled poorly.

Applying more Effort can lower a task's difficulty further: each additional level of Effort eases the task by another step. Applying one level of Effort eases the task by one step, applying two levels eases the task by two steps, and so on. However, each level of Effort after the first costs only 2 points from the stat Pool instead of 3. So applying two levels of Effort costs 5 points (3 for the first level plus 2 for the second level), applying three levels costs 7 points (3 plus 2 plus 2), and so on.

Every character has an Effort score, which indicates the maximum number of levels of Effort that can be applied to a roll. A beginning (first-tier) character has an Effort of 1, meaning you can apply only one level of Effort to a roll. A more experienced character has a higher Effort score and can apply more levels of Effort to a roll. For example, a character who has an Effort of 3 can apply up to three levels of Effort to reduce a task's difficulty.

When you apply Effort, subtract your relevant Edge from the total cost of applying Effort. For example, let's say you need to make a Speed roll. To increase your chance for success, you decide to apply one level of Effort, which will ease the task. Normally, that would cost 3 points from your Speed Pool. However, you have a Speed Edge of 2, so you subtract that from the cost. Thus, applying Effort to the roll costs only 1 point from your Speed Pool.

What if you applied two levels of Effort to the Speed roll instead of just one? That would ease the task by two steps. Normally, it would cost 5 points from your Speed Pool, but after subtracting your Speed Edge of 2, it costs only 3 points.

Once a stat's Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort for free. For example, if you have a Speed Edge of 3 and you apply one level of Effort to a Speed roll, it costs you 0 points from your Speed Pool. (Normally, applying one level of Effort would cost 3 points, but you subtract your Speed Edge from that cost, reducing it to 0.)

Skills and other advantages also ease a task, and you can use them in conjunction with Effort. In addition, your character might have special abilities or equipment that allow you to apply Effort to accomplish a special effect, such as knocking down a foe with an attack or affecting multiple targets with a power that normally affects only one.

When applying Effort to melee attacks, you have the option of spending points from either your Might Pool or your Speed Pool. When making ranged attacks, you may spend points only from your Speed Pool. This reflects that with melee you sometimes use brute force and sometimes use finesse, but with ranged attacks, it's always about careful targeting.

**Editor's Notes —** You can increase your Effort score through character advancement. For more on Effort, see Clarification: Effort and Edge and Effort in Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game.

### EFFORT AND DAMAGE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 16)

Instead of applying Effort to ease your attack, you can apply Effort to increase the amount of damage you inflict with an attack. For each level of Effort you apply in this way, you inflict 3 additional points of damage. This works for any kind of attack that inflicts damage, whether a sword, a crossbow, a mind blast, or something else.

When using Effort to increase the damage of an area attack, such as the explosion created by an Adept's Concussion ability, you inflict 2 additional points of damage instead of 3 points. However, the additional points are dealt to all targets in the area. Further, even if one or more of the targets resist the attack, they still take 1 point of damage.

### MULTIPLE USES OF EFFORT AND EDGE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 16)

If your Effort is 2 or higher, you can apply Effort to multiple aspects of a single action. For example, if you make an attack, you can apply Effort to your attack roll and apply Effort to increase the damage.

The total amount of Effort you apply can't be higher than your Effort score. For example, if your Effort is 2, you can apply up to two levels of Effort. You could apply one level to an attack roll and one level to its damage, two levels to the attack and no levels to the damage, or no levels to the attack and two levels to the damage.

You can use Edge for a particular stat only once per action. For example, if you apply Effort to a Might attack roll and to your damage, you can use your Might Edge to reduce the cost of one of those uses of Effort, not both. If you spend 1 Intellect point to activate your mind blast and one level of Effort to ease the attack roll, you can use your Intellect Edge to reduce the cost of one of those things, not both.

### STAT EXAMPLES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 16)

A beginning character is fighting a giant rat. The PC stabs their spear at the rat, which is a level 2 creature and thus has a target number of 6. The character stands atop a boulder and strikes downward at the beast, and the GM rules that this helpful tactic is an asset that eases the attack by one step (to difficulty 1). That lowers the target number to 3. Attacking with a spear is a Might action; the character has a Might Pool of 11 and a Might Edge of 0. Before making the roll, they decide to apply a level of Effort to ease the attack. That costs 3 points from their Might Pool, reducing the Pool to 8. But the points are well spent. Applying the Effort lowers the difficulty from 1 to 0, so no roll is needed—the attack automatically succeeds.

Another character is attempting to convince a guard to let them into a private office to speak to an influential noble. The GM rules that this is an Intellect action. The character is third tier and has an Effort of 3, an Intellect Pool of 13, and an Intellect Edge of 1. Before making the roll, they must decide whether to apply Effort. They can choose to apply one, two, or three levels of Effort, or apply none at all. This action is important to them, so they decide to apply two levels of Effort, easing the task by two steps. Thanks to their Intellect Edge, applying the Effort costs only 4 points from their Intellect Pool (3 points for the first level of Effort plus 2 points for the second level minus 1 point for their Edge). Spending those points reduces their Intellect Pool to 9. The GM decides that convincing the guard is a difficulty 3 (demanding) task with a target number of 9; applying two levels of Effort reduces the difficulty to 1 (simple) and the target number to 3. The player rolls a d20 and gets an 8. Because this result is at least equal to the target number of the task, they succeed. However, if they had not applied some Effort, they would have failed because their roll (8) would have been less than the task's original target number (9).

### CLARIFICATION: EFFORT AND EDGE

_This section is based on social media posts made by Cypher System designers [Bruce R. Cordell](https://twitter.com/brucecordell/status/1283056573498052609) and [Sean K. Reynolds](https://twitter.com/seankreynolds/status/1282740692674940928), and input from others._

---

While the description of Edge says "once a stat's Edge reaches 3, you can apply one level of Effort for free", that's not strictly true—your Edge of 3 is subtracted from the cost of spending the 3 points to use that level of Effort, negating the cost of using it. Furthermore, the final paragraph of Multiple Uses of Effort and Edge might lead one to believe that cost reductions for using abilities and using Effort are separate, potentially causing a remainder of Edge to go to waste, but this isn't the case. Instead, when resolving an action:

1. Total all Pool point costs for the task stat—including Effort used, special abilities activated, Speed Effort cost for wearing armor, or an initial cost determined by the GM. Most of the time, all costs are paid from the same Pool as the task stat, and resolved with a single task roll.
    
2. Subtract each stat's Edge from its total Pool point cost. Pay any remaining costs.
    

For example, if you attack with your Onslaught ability (1 Intellect point), and use one level of Effort to ease the attack (3 Intellect points), and a second level of Effort to increase the damage (2 Intellect points), the total cost for the action is 6 Intellect points. An Intellect Edge of 3 would then reduce the cost of the action to 3 Intellect points.

#### POOL COSTS FOR EFFORT AND EDGE

The following table displays levels of Effort, their effective change in task difficulty, and the number of Pool points spent, adjusted for Edge. Most of the time, you can consult the table, then add any costs from special abilities or initial cost incurred by the task for a total.

Pool Costs for Simplified Effort and Edge

|Effort Used|Target Number Modification|Task Success Rate|1 Weakness|0 Edge|1 Edge|2 Edge|3 Edge|4 Edge|5 Edge|6 Edge|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|0 levels|—|—|0–1†|—|—|—|—|—|—|—|
|1 level|(−3)|+15%|4|3|2|1|—|—|—|—|
|2 levels|(−6)|+30%|6|5|4|3|2|1|—|—|
|3 levels|(−9)|+45%|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|
|4 levels|(−12)|+60%|10|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|
|5 levels|(−15)|+75%|12|11|10|9|8|7|6|5|
|6 levels|(−18)|+90%|14|13|12|11|10|9|8|7|

- † — Weakness is like negative Edge. If PC pays Pool points for performing the task from a stat with which they have a weakness, the cost is increased still by 1, even if no Effort was used.

#### ACTIONS WITH MULTIPLE TASKS

In the game rules, "action", "task", and "roll" are used almost interchangeably, but there is a kind of hierarchy to them:

- When the PC takes action on their own turn, the GM might call for one or more tasks, each with its own difficulty.
- If the PC modifies the difficulty down to 0, they succeed automatically, and don't need to make a roll.
- If the player doesn't roll the die, they cannot trigger a special rolls—including GM intrusion.

Most of the time, PCs can spend Effort on each task they perform (and thus each roll they make). Let's examine a few examples:

- **Defending:** Because the player always rolls, PCs often have to frantically perform actions and tasks—even when it isn't their turn. For example, let's say you are fighting a giant squid. You might end up spending Effort on several Speed defense tasks. Each of these is an action—one the PC didn't choose—but they can choose how much Effort to use on each one.
    
- **Complex Actions:** A PC has lot more agency when it comes to the action they take on their turn. Most of the time, a PC's action is resolved in just one task, but there are exceptions. For example, let's say you use your action to move a short distance and make an attack. If you fail the assigned difficulty 4 Speed task, you don't get to make the attack at all. Using Effort might make the difference, so forcing you to decide how much Effort to withhold for a second task—one that might not even occur—only complicates your decision-making and slows down the game. By providing an opportunity to use as much Effort as you want on the prerequisite task, the game naturally creates an initial cost for pushing the limit of what can be accomplished with just one action.
    
- **Special Abilities:** A few special abilities allow PCs to perform multiple tasks "as part of the same action", for example, Dual Light Wield and Fleet of Foot. Others create new uses for Effort, for example, Hemorrhage and Reveal. When this is the case, the ability will any explain special uses or restrictions on diving your Effort among multiple tasks.
    
- **Effort and Edge:** Remember that while Effort use is limited by each task, Edge reduces stat Pool point costs only once for an action—even if that action prompted multiple tasks and cost expenditures.

#### HOUSE RULE: USING OTHER POOLS TO PAY COST REMAINDERS

_This section has been added by the editor._

---

If you lack the available Pool points to pay the cost of performing a task, you can pay the remainder of the cost from your other Pools, in the same order they are depleted by taking damage: Might, then Speed, and finally, Intellect. When you do, you don't change your position on the damage track as a result of the expenditure until after the task is resolved.

Using this house rule, a wizard who is out of "mana" (Intellect points) might resort to blood sacrifice, casting spells by spending points from their Might Pool instead. A battered warrior whose Might and Speed pools are nearly depleted might yet be able to mount a defense—or final heroic act—by mustering their willpower (Intellect points). In either case, this is a risky strategy—placing PCs at risk of quickly moving even further down the damage track.

---

#### HOUSE RULE: USING EFFORT AFTER ROLLING THE DIE

_This section has been added by the editor._

---

When you roll the die, you can choose to use Effort after result of the roll is determined. Using Effort in this way might turn a failure into a success, inflict additional damage, or do something else specified by a special ability.

**Special Rolls:** The GM decides if Pool point costs for using Effort in this way are regained after a special roll of 20.

Using this house rule, players never need to feel like Effort used was "wasted" because of a low roll. However, their newly acquired efficiency in Pool point expenditure might require the GM to find new ways of challenging the PCs.

---

## CHARACTER TIERS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 17)

Every character starts the game at the first tier. Tier is a measurement of power, toughness, and ability. Characters can advance up to the sixth tier. As your character advances to higher tiers, you gain more abilities, increase your Effort, and can improve a stat's Edge or increase a stat. Generally speaking, even first-tier characters are already quite capable. It's safe to assume that they've already got some experience under their belt. This is not a "zero to hero" progression, but rather an instance of competent people refining and honing their capabilities and knowledge. Advancing to higher tiers is not really the goal of Cypher System characters, but rather a representation of how characters progress in a story.

To progress to the next tier, characters earn experience points (XP) by pursuing character arcs, going on adventures, and discovering new things—the system is about both discovery and exploration, as well as achieving personal goals. Experience points have many uses, and one use is to purchase character benefits. After your character purchases four character benefits, they advance to the next tier. Each benefit costs 4 XP, and you can purchase them in any order, but you must purchase one of each kind of benefit (and then advance to the next tier) before you can purchase the same benefit again. The four character benefits are as follows.

- **Increasing Capabilities:** You gain 4 points to add to your stat Pools. You can allocate the points among the Pools however you wish.
    
- **Moving Toward Perfection:** You add 1 to your Might Edge, your Speed Edge, or your Intellect Edge (your choice).
    
- **Extra Effort:** Your Effort score increases by 1.
    
- **Skills:** You become trained in one skill of your choice, other than attacks or defense. As described in Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game, a character trained in a skill treats the difficulty of a related task as one step lower than normal. The skill you choose for this benefit can be anything you wish, such as climbing, jumping, persuading, or sneaking. You can also choose to be knowledgeable in a certain area of lore, such as history or geology. You can even choose a skill based on your character's special abilities. For example, if your character can make an Intellect roll to blast an enemy with mental force, you can become trained in using that ability, easing the task of using it. If you choose a skill that you are already trained in, you become specialized in that skill, easing related tasks by two steps instead of one.
    
- **Other Options:** Players can also spend 4 XP to purchase other special options in lieu of gaining a new skill. Selecting any of these options counts as the skill benefit necessary to advance to the next tier. The special options are as follows:
    
    - Reduce the cost for wearing armor. This option lowers the Speed cost for wearing armor by 1.
    - Add 2 to your recovery rolls.
    - Select a new type-based ability from your tier or a lower tier.

Skills are a broad category of things your character can learn and accomplish. For a list of sample skills, see below.

**Editor's Notes —** For more on Character Advancement, see Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game.

## CHARACTER DESCRIPTOR, TYPE, AND FOCUS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 18)

To create your character, you build a simple statement that describes them. The statement takes this form:

"I am an [adjective] [noun] who [verbs]."

In this sentence, the adjective is called your descriptor. Your descriptor defines your character—it colors everything you do. Unless your GM says otherwise, you can choose from any of the character descriptors.

The noun is your character type. Your character type is the core of your character. In some roleplaying games, it might be called your character class.

The verb is called your focus. Focus is what your character does best. Focus gives your character specificity and provides interesting new abilities that might come in handy. Your focus also helps you understand how you relate with the other player characters in your group. The foci you choose from will probably depend on the setting and genre of your game.

You can use the Flavors chapter to slightly modify character types to customize them for different genres.

## CYPHER SYSTEM CHARACTER SENTENCE GENERATOR

To create your character, you make a simple statement that describes them. The character sentence takes this form:

- New Descriptor
    
 - New Type
    
 - New Flavor
    
 - New Focus
    
 - New Arc

"I am an [adjective] [noun] who [verbs]."

"I am a [descriptor] [type] who [focus]."

"I am an Uncanny Warrior who Absorbs Energy."

"I seek to Join an Organization."

### CHARACTER CREATION CHECKLIST

Available character options are determined by the GM.

1. Choose a descriptor and focus first. These are the core parts of your character's identity.
    
2. Choose the type that best completes your character concept. If you feel there's something missing, talk to the GM about adding a flavor.
    
3. Choose a character arc. If the GM allows, you might be able to change your character options by completing certain character arcs.
    
4. Talk to the GM about equipment or cyphers you will start the game with, or any further customization or optional rules that affect character creation.
    
5. Gather together with the GM and PCs and start playing the Cypher System!

## SPECIAL ABILITIES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 18)

Character types and foci grant PCs special abilities at each new tier. Using these abilities usually costs points from your stat Pools; the cost is listed in parentheses after the ability name. Your Edge in the appropriate stat can reduce the cost of the ability, but remember that you can apply Edge only once per action. For example, let's say an Adept with an Intellect Edge of 2 wants to use their Onslaught ability to create a bolt of force, which costs 1 Intellect point. They also want to increase the damage from the attack by using a level of Effort, which costs 3 Intellect points. The total cost for their action is 2 points from their Intellect Pool (1 point for the bolt of force, plus 3 points for using Effort, minus 2 points from their Edge).

- **Ability Costs and Effort:** Sometimes the point cost for an ability has a + sign after the number. For example, the cost might be given as "2+ Intellect points." That means you can spend more points or more levels of Effort to improve the ability further, as explained in the ability description.
    
- **Action Abilities:** Many special abilities grant a character the option to perform an action that they couldn't normally do, such as projecting rays of cold or attacking multiple foes at once. Using one of these abilities is an action unto itself, and the end of the ability's description says "Action" to remind you. It also might provide more information about when or how you perform the action.
    
- **Enabler Abilities:** Some special abilities allow you to perform a familiar action—one that you can already do—in a different way. For example, an ability might let you wear heavy armor, reduce the difficulty of Speed defense rolls, or add 2 points of fire damage to your weapon damage. These abilities are called enablers. Using one of these abilities is not considered an action. Enablers either function constantly (such as being able to wear heavy armor, which isn't an action) or happen as part of another action (such as adding fire damage to your weapon damage, which happens as part of your attack action). If a special ability is an enabler, the end of the ability's description says "Enabler" to remind you.
    
- **Ability Durations:** Some abilities specify a duration, but you can always end one of your own abilities anytime you wish.
    

Because the Cypher System covers so many genres, not all of the descriptors, types, and foci might be available for players. The GM will decide what's available in their particular game and whether anything is modified, and they'll let the players know.

**Editor's Notes —** For more on special abilities, see Chapter 9: : Abilities, and Action: Activate a Special Ability.

## SKILLS

### QUICK REFERENCE: SKILLS

The Cypher System has no definitive list of skills. However, the following list offers ideas:

- Astronomy
- Balancing
- Biology
- Botany
- Carrying
- Climbing
- Computers
- Deceiving
- Disguise
- Escaping
- Geography
- Geology
- Healing
- History
- Identifying
- Initiative
- Intimidation
- Jumping
- Leatherworking
- Lockpicking
- Machinery
- Metalworking
- Perception
- Persuasion
- Philosophy
- Physics
- Pickpocketing
- Piloting
- Repairing
- Riding
- Smashing
- Sneaking
- Stealth
- Swimming
- Vehicle driving
- Woodworking

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 19)

Sometimes your character gains training in a specific skill or task. For example, your focus might mean that you're trained in sneaking, in climbing and jumping, or in social interactions. Other times, your character can choose a skill to become trained in, and you can pick a skill that relates to any task you think you might face.

You could choose a skill that incorporates more than one of these areas (interacting might include deceiving, intimidation, and persuasion) or that is a more specific version of one (hiding might be sneaking when you're not moving). You could also make up more general professional skills, such as baker, sailor, or lumberjack. If you want to choose a skill that's not on this list, it's probably best to run it past the GM first, but in general, the most important thing is to choose skills that are appropriate to your character.

Remember that if you gain a skill that you're already trained in, you become specialized in that skill. Because skill descriptions can be nebulous, determining whether you're trained or specialized might take some thinking. For example, if you're trained in lying and later gain an ability that grants you skill with all social interactions, you become specialized in lying and trained in all other types of interactions. Being trained three times in a skill is no better than being trained twice (in other words, specialized is as good as it gets).

Only skills gained through character type abilities or other rare instances allow you to become skilled with attack or defense tasks.

If you gain a special ability through your type, your focus, or some other aspect of your character, you can choose it in place of a skill and become trained or specialized in that ability. For example, if you have a mind blast, when it's time to choose a skill to be trained in, you can select your mind blast as your skill. That would ease the attack every time you used it. Each ability you have counts as a separate skill for this purpose. You can't select "all mind powers" or "all spells" as one skill and become trained or specialized in such a broad category.

### LANGUAGES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 19)

In most campaigns, fluency in a language is considered a skill. So if you want to speak French, that's the same as being trained in biology or swimming.

### CLARIFICATION: SKILL TRAINING

_This section has been added by the editor to make clear the effects of inabilities._

---

As defined in the Key Concepts, having an inability is the opposite of being trained—you're hindered whenever you attempt a task that you have an inability in. If you also become trained in the task, the training and the inability cancel each other out and you become practiced. You can gain new skills or improve your existing skills through character advancement.

Skill Level and Task Difficulty

|Skill Level|Task Difficulty|Target Number Modification|Task Success Rate|
|---|---|---|---|
|Inability|hindered by one step|(+3)|−15%|
|Practiced|—|—|—|
|Trained|eased by one step|(−3)|+15%|
|Specialized|eased by two steps|(−6)|+30%|

#### HOUSE RULE: SKILLS FROM BACKGROUNDS

_This section is based on Skills from Backgrounds (235) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

The GM can allow players to choose one or two additional narrow skills appropriate to their PC's background. For example, if an Adept's family owns a large vineyard as a result of rolling on the Adept Background Connection table, they might be skilled in wine-making or being a sommelier. Background skills aren't immediately applicable to the game's primary adventures, but should instead address other aspects of the PC, world, or setting. Skills with attacks, defense, or wearing armor are not appropriate background skills.

The GM can also use the Further Customization or XP Advance optional rules to allow PCs to start the game trained in even more skills.
