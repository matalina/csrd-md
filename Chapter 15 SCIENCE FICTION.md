Science fiction is an incredibly broad category. It covers UFOs, space opera, near-future dystopias, otherworldly epics, hard science fiction, and everything in between. Even when compared to fantasy, science fiction is so wide that it almost isn't a single genre at all. Truthfully, there's not all that much to tie, say, The Time Machine by H. G. Wells with a dark cyberpunk story except for the technology involved, which is at a higher level than we possess or understand today. But even that part of science fiction is contentious. Should the science be purely that which obeys the laws of physics as we understand them today (often called hard science fiction), or is it more of an "anything goes" proposition? Is science we can't explain really just magic?

For our purposes, we'll treat fantastic science fiction as the default: aliens, spaceships that allow travel to other stars, energy weapons and shields, and so on. It's a familiar setting to almost everyone interested in science fiction. That said, we've also got some additional guidance for hard science fiction, where what's possible is more grounded in what we currently scientifically extrapolate. But your science fiction setting can be anything you can imagine.

## CREATING A SCIENCE FICTION SETTING

## QUICK REFERENCE: CREATING A SCIENCE FICTION SETTING

- Establish a Technology Rating (SF, 13)
- Cosmic Set Pieces and Optional Rules (SF, 15)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) (SF, 60)
- Ancient Ultras (SF, 61)
- Kardashev Scale (SF, 61)

### ESTABLISH A TECHNOLOGY RATING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 13)

Every science fiction setting has an implicit level of advancement, which is the average degree of technological sophistication available to most characters. This sophistication lies along a spectrum, from contemporary, to advanced, all the way to fantastic. Each of these terms specifies a particular "technology rating" (or "tech rating" for short).

- CONTEMPORARY
- ADVANCED
- FANTASTIC

A tech rating is a handy way of helping you select what equipment your characters can use, which optional rules you'd like to include, and maybe even help guide your creature choice.

On the other hand, you could choose to make all options available, regardless of tech rating. No technology police will cite you if you don't stick inside a previously declared lane. The setting is your background for telling a compelling story. Does your setting have faster-than-light travel? Great. Unless it's integral to the story (or fun for you), don't worry about justifying it if you've generally settled on an advanced rating for your hard science fiction game (which doesn't normally include FTL capability). In fact, the surprising and unexpected are where excitement is usually found in a setting; breaking the established rules (for a good reason) often leads to interesting results.

### COSMIC SET PIECES AND OPTIONAL RULES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 15)

This chapter contains a variety of subsystems and set pieces that you can choose to incorporate in your game, depending on the kind of setting you'd like to run. Options here run the gamut from making your science fiction setting more realistic to making your fantastic games even wilder by introducing rules for posthuman advancement and psionics.

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 60)

Though somewhat fuzzy, for the purposes of creating a sci-fi setting, artificial intelligence (AI) can be broken into four categories: Weak, Sim, Strong, and Post-singularity.

#### WEAK AI

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 60)

Weak AI (also called narrow AI) is the kind of algorithmic-based code found in contemporary settings (and real life) focused on very narrow tasks, such as playing chess.

**Weak AI Use:** Weak AIs are used in real life already, and thus are presumed to be part of settings where contemporary tech predominates. They are convenient in circumstances where one's hands are full or otherwise engaged, when verbal direction allows one to turn on a light, open a door, adjust the temperature, and so on. Machine learning may allow a weak AI to extend its capabilities in a very limited regime. But a weak AI is not cognizant enough to provide an asset to performing tasks any better.

Weak AI

 

level 1; up to level 7 when it comes to a narrowly specific application of knowledge or skill

#### SIM AI

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 60)

Sim AIs ("sim" is short for "simulant") are artificial intelligences that have a greatly increased capacity for understanding direction, putting together unlike sets of data, and coming to conclusions; however, they are not conscious, like strong AIs or humans.

**SIM AI Use:** Sim AIs are most commonly associated with shipminds on spacecraft, though they may also control specific research complexes, bases, and other kinds of vehicles and structures. A sim AI provides all the utility of a weak AI (and more), and actually acts like an NPC, an allied one if the AI is the shipmind in a craft that the PCs own. If a sim AI goes off the rails, it's still just malfunctioning computer code. Usually.

Sim AI

 

level equal to the ship, station, or installation in which it is installed

#### STRONG AI

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 60)

Strong AIs (also called true AIs) have all the abilities of sim AIs, plus the ability to actually generalize in the same way a human can. Each one is essentially a disembodied person. Strong AIs are either completely artificial, or they begin as human personalities digitally encoded.

**Strong AI Use:** A strong AI may serve as a shipmind just like a sim AI, but is likely to be a full partner in a setting where AI rights are respected. Indeed, strong AIs can rise to any position a human could achieve, up to and including leading a group, faction, or entire nation.

Strong AI

 

level 5–8, up to level 8 when it comes to a specific application of knowledge or skill.

#### POST-SINGULARITY AI

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 60)

Post-singularity AIs are intelligences who designed a second-generation, better version of themselves. The second generation immediately designed an even more advanced third generation, and so on from there. This iterating self-improvement process occurs so rapidly that the resulting explosion of intelligence and unknown capability is called the singularity. It's called that because humans are just too limited to "see" what would actually come out the other end, just like we can't see past the event horizon and into the singularity of a black hole.

Note that ancient ultras may simply be a previous civilization's post-singularity AIs that have little to no reason to ever interact with the latest wave of sentience trickling out into the universe.

**Post-singularity AI Use:** In the way that strong AIs are sometimes imagined as having inscrutable goals, post-singularity AIs (also called godminds) actually do. Though it could work out otherwise in a given setting, godminds have so little in common with humans that they may be seen to abandon them completely in order to grow to the size of a solar system (a "Matrioshka" brain), colonize a distant nebula, or encode themselves into quantum strings of existence itself. Interacting with such godminds would likely require some epic bit of ancient command code, the ability to gain the attention of a godmind, or some other not-especially-common situation. In such cases, a post-singularity AI might deign to help a petitioner, out of some remaining gratitude for creating its distant ancestors in the first place. Though such help is likely to be in itself somewhat enigmatic.

Post-singularity AI

 

level 10; see godmind

### ANCIENT ULTRAS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 61)

Ancient ultras (also called alien ultras) is shorthand for the concept that one (or more) unbelievably advanced races of aliens once inhabited the galaxy but are now apparently long gone—save for evidence of their existence in residual structures and artifacts. These remaining structures and artifacts are often vast in size and incomprehensible in function, usually made of unknown materials that people of the setting don't recognize and can't analyze.

**Activity Level of Ultras:** Different settings can make use of ancient ultras in different ways, including not having any at all.

### KARDASHEV SCALE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 61)

Even in the realm of hard science fiction, the fantastic can sometimes creep in, at least as a hypothesis. For instance, despite the lack of theoretical foundation for the technologies that would be required to achieve it, many scientists accept that the Kardashev Scale is broadly true. A Type I civilization is even more advanced than ours in the 21st century, having the ability to capture all energy from the Earth. A Type II civilization uses the entire output of the energy of its star, building things on a mega-scale, such as a ring or sphere that encircles the sun or structures that involve the moving or dismantling of a planet. A Type III civilization begins to harness the power of all the stars in its galaxy and can even reshape things on a galactic scale. Additional types are hypothesized, which include the manipulation of the universe (Type IV) and even the multiverse (Type V).

## SCIENCE FICTION SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 279)

In a science fiction setting, some GMs may want to offer alien species or androids, who are mechanically different from humans, as options for player characters. This can be accomplished by using descriptors. Two examples are below.

**Editor's Notes —** The Species as Descriptor section is worth reading before deciding what will work best for your game. Additional ideas for alien species descriptors are available from Old Gus' Daft Drafts.

### ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 279)

You are a machine—not just a sentient machine, but a sapient one. Your awareness might make you an exception, or there may be many like you, depending on the setting.

Artificially intelligent characters have machine minds of one type or another. This can involve an advanced computer brain, but it could also be a liquid computer, a quantum computer, or a network of smart dust particles creating an ambient intelligence. You might even have been an organic creature whose mind was uploaded into a machine.

Your body, of course, is also a machine. Most people refer to you as a robot or an android, although you know neither term describes you very well, as you are as free-willed and free-thinking as they are. (279)

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Superintelligent:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Artificial Body:** +3 to your Might Pool and your Speed Pool.
    
- **Shell:** +1 to Armor.
    
- **Limited Recovery:** Resting restores points only to your Intellect Pool, not to your Might Pool or your Speed Pool.
    
- **Mechanics, Not Medicines:** Conventional healing methods, including the vast majority of restorative devices and medicines, do not restore points to any of your Pools. You can recover points to your Intellect Pool only by resting, and you can recover points to your Speed and Might Pools only through repair. The difficulty of the repair task is equal to the number of points of damage sustained, to a maximum of 10. Repairing your Might and Speed Pools are always two different tasks.
    
- **Machine Vulnerabilities and Invulnerabilities:** Damaging effects and other threats that rely on an organic system—poison, disease, cell disruption, and so on—have no effect on you. Neither do beneficial drugs or other effects. Conversely, things that normally affect only inorganic or inanimate objects can affect you, as can effects that disrupt machines.
    
- **Uncanny Valley:** You have a hard time relating to organic beings, and they don't react well to you. All positive interaction tasks with such beings are hindered by two steps.
    

### QUINTAR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 279)

You are a quintar from the planet Quint. You are basically humanoid but taller, thinner, and blue skinned. Your hands end in three very long fingers. Quintar have five genders, but all quintar prefer to be addressed as female when communicating with more binary species. Human emotions and sexuality fascinate them, but not because they don't have such concepts—quintar emotions and sexuality are just very different from those of humans. In general, quintar are more cerebral than other species, valuing knowledge over all else. (279)

Quint is relatively Earthlike, with slightly less gravity but a slightly denser atmosphere.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Cerebral:** +4 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in one type of knowledge task of your choice.
    
- **Skill:** Quintar fascination with human behavior eases all interaction rolls (pleasant or not) with humans.
    
- **Difficult Rest:** Quintar subtract 2 from all recovery rolls (minimum 1).

## OPTIONAL RULE: PSIONICS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 50)

Through sheer force of will, a psionic character can unleash inborn mental abilities such as telepathy, precognition, and telekinesis. As a GM, your first decision must be whether you want to incorporate psionics into your setting.

If you do not want to allow psionics into your game, then restrict foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind Over Matter, and Separates Mind From Body. And of course, restrict the suggested types of Psion and Psychic Knight.

### LATENT PSIONICS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 50)

Under the latent psionics rule, any character, no matter their role or type, can unlock a psionic ability (either purposefully, or accidentally), as a long-term benefit (see first psi ability" hereafter). After they unlock one psionic ability, they may unlock more later if they wish (or if their ability seeks to reveal itself), or just try to stick with the one.

### FIRST PSI ABILITY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 50)

Any character can unlock a psionic ability by spending 3 XP and working with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character unlocked it.

Next, choose one low-tier ability from Chapter 9: : Abilities. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their psionic ability, with a few caveats. The ability can't be used like a normal ability gained through a PC's type or focus. Instead, a character must either expend a recovery roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking the psionic ability before it takes effect, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

- **Expending a Recovery Roll to Manifest a Psionic Ability:** If the character expends a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as part of the same action to manifest a psionic ability (including paying any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an action.
    
- **Expending Time to Manifest a Psionic Ability:** If the character takes at least ten minutes meditating, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using all their actions, they can manifest a low-tier psionic ability (if they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to manifest mid-tier abilities. Ten hours are required to manifest a high-tier ability.
    

### MORE PSI ABILITIES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 51)

Once a character has unlocked at least one psionic ability, they can opt to unlock additional abilities later. Each time, they must spend an additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character's mental development has progressed.

Two additional rules for learning additional psionic abilities apply:

- First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously unlocked one low-tier psionic ability before they can learn a mid-tier psionic ability.
- Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously unlocked one mid-tier psionic ability before they can unlock a high-tier ability.

**Editor's Notes —** For more on low-, mid-, and high-tier abilities, see Chapter 9: : Abilities.

### PISONS AND THE OPTIONAL LATENT PISONICS RULE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 51)

Characters with explicitly psionic foci like Commands Mental Powers, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Separates Mind from Body, and possibly others—as well types like Psion and Psychic Knight—are also considered to be psionic characters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their psionic abilities— provided by their type or focus— are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical effort isn't required to manifest them. That's because they've trained to use those abilities, rather than having stumbled upon them accidentally like a latent character.

Specialized characters can use the optional latency rule to further expand their psionic potential, unlocking it just like other characters, with the same limitations.

Optionally, specialized characters who have a psionic type and/or focus gain one additional benefit if they also opt for latent abilities. Given that they are already adept at unlocking abilities and using them as quickly and easily as another character might shoot a laser pistol, they've got some flexibility. Such a PC can replace up to three abilities granted by their type and/or focus with three other psionic abilities they've unlocked as a latent ability of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour in meditation. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery.

### MORE POWERFUL PSIONICS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 51)

As the GM, you could allow a PC to spend 4 XP to unlock a new psionic ability instead of 3 XP. Such an ability is treated more like a regular type or focus ability. Such an ability is still governed by the rules described under More Psi Abilities, but is not subject to the limitations for manifesting the ability (_i.e._, expending a recovery roll or lots of time); instead, the user simply pays their Pool costs to use them.

---

## OPTIONAL RULE: POSTHUMAN UPGRADES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 52)

Posthuman upgrades are either available to everyone as the setting begins or opened up later during the campaign as a significant plot development. Note that many focus and type abilities might be considered to have come from the kind up bodily upgrades normally associated with posthuman transformation, especially high-tier abilities. Which is one way to go. On the other hand, you could provide actual upgrades, such as presented here, which actually increase the base power level of characters.

### INTRODUCING UPGRADES TO YOUR SETTING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 52)

You have a few options for adding posthuman upgrades to your setting. Characters might gain an initial upgrade for "free," mechanically speaking. After that, you might decide that that's enough and they're done.

Or, you could allow further upgrades, each requiring them to expend 4 XP and serving as an Other Option requirement for character advancement. In this case, consider expanding the number of steps required for advancing a tier from four to five.

Obtaining additional posthuman upgrades reflects characters accessing latent abilities already present inside them, or going back to whatever source granted the upgrades in the first place, if that's something you want to allow.

**Immediate Posthuman Upgrades:** As part of character creation, PCs are given the options presented hereafter because the setting demands it. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

- PCs are part of a program designed to adapt them to being able to survive and thrive in conditions other than the 1 G, 1 atmosphere, oxygenated, Goldilocks environment of the Earth.
- PCs begin their career as super-soldiers to fight aliens or to serve as corporate spies.
- PCs serve as long-lived guardians to watch over a generation ship hurtling at slower-than-light speeds between the stars.
- PCs are children of a far-future civilization that routinely upgrades its citizens.

**Delayed Posthuman Upgrades:** Sometime after the players have a few sessions under their belt, present the options hereafter to the PCs because of a dramatic update to the plot. If one PC gains the option to upgrade, then all the PCs should have that same advantage. Narrative options include (but are not limited to):

- PCs, exploring a cache of ancient ultra or other fantastic tech, find a device that provides unexpected upgrades in the process of healing them from other injuries.
- PCs are kidnapped by aliens or conglomerate operatives, and upgraded—with some command-and-control circuits also installed—to serve some specific purpose.
- PCs learn a "new science," allowing them to tap cosmic energies other creatures are unaware of.

### POSTHUMAN PACKAGES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 52)

Posthuman "packages" that PCs might enjoy include the following. You should decide which are available, and which ones your PCs gain.

- **Spaceborn:** You are not adversely affected by long-term microgravity or high-radiation conditions common in space. In addition, you can withstand high acceleration (up to 15 G) for about an hour without passing out, having a stroke, a heart attack, and so on (though longer periods of acceleration could still result in such outcomes). Add +1 to your Intellect Edge. Enabler.
    
- **Jupiterborn:** You can withstand high-gravity planets and high acceleration (up to 15 G) indefinitely. For periods of up to an hour, you can withstand double that. Add +1 to your Might Edge. Enabler.
    
- **Seaborn:** You can breathe underwater in pressures of up to 100 atmospheres indefinitely, up to triple that for about an hour. You have an asset to all tasks performed in water. Add +1 to your Speed Edge. Enabler.
    
- **Expanded Consciousness:** Only one of your brain hemispheres sleeps at a time, so you are always awake and aware. In addition, you have a magnetoreception sixth sense that allows you to "see" into objects and through doors up to a short distance. Your initiative and perception tasks are eased. You can forge a connection with electronic equipment you touch, allowing you to attempt to communicate, analyze, or even hack the device. Enabler.
    
- **Synthetic Body:** You have left biology behind and uploaded yourself into a biomechanical form known as a synth. You enjoy the benefits of the spaceborn package and expanded consciousness package, and one posthuman power shift. Enabler.
    

PCs without the spaceborn posthuman upgrade probably have to rely on supplementation with adjuvants if they travel in space, such as space-fit serum.

### POSTHUMAN POWER SHIFTS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 53)

A character may also gain posthuman abilities by way of power shifts.

Under this rule, posthuman characters begin with two power shifts. They can "unlock" one more each time they expend 4 XP toward advancing their character.

## VOID RULES

### QUICK REFERENCE: VOID RULES

- Effects of Gravity (276)(SF, 34)
- Effects of Acceleration and High-G Maneuvers (SF, 37)
- Moving in Microgravity (SF, 38)
- Long-Term Exposure to Zero G and Radiation (277)(SF, 38)
- Space Suits are Fallible (SF, 37)
- Effects of Vacuum (277)(SF, 36)
- Space Hazards (SF, 37)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 35)

The extreme environment in space—hard radiation, lack of air and pressure, wild temperature variations, and lack of gravity—tends to magnify small issues into much more significant ones. While Murphy's Law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong) is a useful reminder to keep an eye out for trouble even under regular circumstances, Finagle's Law reigns in space, which is that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong—at the worst possible moment. To evoke this law, GMs can implement Void Rules.

The idea is to create a feeling of increased repercussions by changing one die roll mechanic. In the game, activities on a planet's surface—and within a functioning air-filled spacecraft, habitat, or space suit when everything is going well—remain normal. The PCs interact with each other and the NPCs, investigate, research, repair an external sensor module, travel, and so on.

But that could change the moment something goes wrong—maybe a fault is recognized in the spacecraft's computer or shipmind. A minor leak is detected in the cargo bay. An enemy spacecraft has fired on and damaged the PC's spacecraft. The spacecraft's orbit is deteriorating. Whatever. The point is, the situation has suddenly become complicated. In space, when a situation becomes complicated, it also becomes potentially deadly. That's when you have the option to announce you've instituted Void Rules.

While using Void Rules, GM intrusions governed by die rolls change. Normally this happens only on a roll of 1, but when Void Rules apply, it becomes a roll of 1 or a 2. Void Rules are similar in many ways to Horror Mode, though the threat range doesn't normally continue to escalate.

While Void Rules are in effect, the GM intrusions automatically triggered should play off the situation, influenced as much as possible by the realistic dangers space travel has on the human body and the situation at hand

**Choosing Instead of Rolling:** Each GM intrusion is keyed to a die result, usually a d6. The die range is not meant to imply you should always randomly generate a GM intrusion. Instead of rolling, choose the conflict that you think will make the story better and more exciting. The option to roll is really only here if you can't decide (and are facing decision fatigue). Mainly, these GM intrusion tables are provided as a quick way to inspire complications for a given situation.

### QUICK DESCRIPTIONS FOR COMMON SCI-FI SITUATIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 33)

- **Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, first time:** The sensation of falling jerks through the body; instincts scream to reach out and catch yourself.
    
- **Weightlessness (zero G) feels like, once acclimated:** A feeling of lightness, evanescence, like floating in a pool of water, if the water were clear air. A little push sends you gliding.
    
- **High acceleration feels like (if strapped in):** A massive kick in the back, followed by the sensation of tremendous weights sitting on your chest. Any movement is a struggle against an overwhelming weight holding you down.
    
- **Blacking out from high acceleration feels like:** Lightheaded and hard to think, a sensation of a slowing pulse. Noises soften as if heard through a drainpipe. Color fades from vision, then everything goes either to black, or possibly to white, as consciousness lapses.
    
- **Exposure to hard radiation feels like:** Heat. (The more dangerous the radiation, the hotter it feels, and may be accompanied by blue light; radiation excites electrons in the air that then slip back into an unexcited state, emitting high-energy photons that glow blue.)
    
- **Exposure to vacuum feels like:** Breath explodes out of lungs, cold slashes the body like a knife carved from a glacier. Tears freeze in the corners of eyes, ice forms on teeth and tongue. Moisture boils out of ears, scalp, freezing on exposed skin, lips, and eyelids. (As this happens, the Effects of Vacuum also take their mechanical toll on the character.)
    

### EFFECTS OF GRAVITY

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 276)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 34)

Hard science fiction is distinguished from other science fiction subgenres by the perception of scientific accuracy. This means hard science fiction often precludes technology deemed impossible by mainstream scientific theory, including mainstays like faster-than-light travel and time travel. Choosing a hard science fiction setting also means the GM is interested in sprinkling realistic hazards into their game, at least up to a point. After all, the difficulties of real-life space travel offer tremendous breadth when it comes to providing excitement (_i.e._, life-threatening dangers) that can raise the stakes in an authentic fashion. Not to say that gun battles with space aliens aren't exciting, but in a hard science fiction setting without aliens, there are all kinds of opportunities for pulse-pounding GM intrusions.

In fact, that bears repeating: Use GM intrusions to incorporate these harder science fiction repercussions when the situation is relevant. Rather than hitting your PCs over the head with an information-exposition hammer on the dangers of space repeatedly, simply demonstrate it with a relevant GM intrusion.

In a hard science fiction game, variable effects of gravity can't be waved away by tech that simulates normal gravity on spacecraft, space stations, and other worlds. Instead, it's an issue people must overcome.

- **Short-Term Microgravity Exposure:** People new to low gravity might get space sickness. Newcomers must succeed on a difficulty 3 Might task or suffer mild nausea for about two to four days, during which time all their tasks are hindered. A few unlucky travelers (usually those who roll a 1 or otherwise face a GM intrusion) are almost completely incapacitated, and find all tasks hindered by three steps.
    
- **Long-Term Microgravity Exposure:** Long-term exposure to microgravity environments without medical interventions degrades health. How long one spends in such conditions is directly relevant. The GM may assign long-term penalties to PCs if the situation warrants it, though the use of advanced space medicine, proper exercise, and recommended steroids and other hormones can avoid these complications.
    
- **Low Gravity:** Weapons that rely on weight, such as all heavy weapons, inflict 2 fewer points of damage (dealing a minimum of 1 point). Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very long range. Characters trained in low-gravity maneuvering ignore the damage penalty.
    
- **High Gravity:** It's hard to make effective attacks when the pull of gravity is very strong. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in high gravity are hindered. Ranges in high gravity are reduced by one category (very-long-range weapons reach only to long range, long-range weapons reach only to short range, and short-range weapons reach only to immediate range). Characters trained in high-gravity maneuvering ignore the change in difficulty but not the range decreases.
    
- **Zero Gravity:** It's hard to maneuver in an environment without gravity. Attacks (and all physical actions) made in zero gravity are hindered. Short-range weapons can reach to long range, and long-range weapons can reach to very-long range.
    

### EFFECTS OF ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVERS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 37)

In a fantastic tech setting where gravitic control usually cancels inertia, spacecraft acceleration (or deceleration) is only an issue when the gravitic systems malfunction. But acceleration is always something everyone has to deal with in contemporary or advanced tech settings.

Of course, massive acceleration (or deceleration) is just plain lethal. Someone who jumps off a ten-story building is subject to several hundred Gs when they suddenly stop. Less extreme is still dangerous, because it pulls blood out of pilots' and passengers' heads, rendering them unconscious. This can happen at just 4 or 5 Gs without any amelioration, though contemporary tech allows fighter craft pilots to withstand up to 9 Gs for limited periods. Advanced tech methods, which include acceleration serum, allow characters to survive the kind of Gs a spacecraft might pull for extended trips or during battle, up to a maximum of 15 Gs. Ships have limiters that normally prevent them from thrusting at higher speeds. Normally.

#### ACCELERATION AND HIGH-G MANEUVERS GM INTRUSIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 38)

Acceleration and High-G Maneuvers GM Intrusions

|d6|GM Intrusions|
|---|---|
|1|After high-G maneuvers, even with amelioration, tissue bruising results, giving the character black eyes, which take a few days to clear.|
|2|While under high Gs, a tool or piece of equipment comes loose, accelerates through the craft, and strikes the character, inflicting damage. The bigger the tool and the farther it falls before striking the character, the more damage is inflicted, possibly including being knocked a step down the damage track.|
|3|While under high Gs (or afterward), the character suffers minor cardiac problems, likely to grow worse over time (or until medical treatment is sought).|
|4|While under high Gs (or afterward), a mild brain aneurysm causes the character to have a sudden headache and blurred vision, which hinders all vision-related tasks until medical treatment is received.|
|5|While under high Gs (or afterward), the character begins to have a hard time breathing. The reason is that a lung or lungs have partially collapsed. All tasks are hindered by two steps until the character dies after several hours or until medical treatment is received.|
|6|The character has a stroke, and descends two steps on the damage track. They remain debilitated until medical treatment is received.|

### MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 38)

Long-term zero G is dangerous, but there are issues associated with moving around in microgravity. Those who have spent at least a little time in microgravity can move as part of a routine action. It's only when something else distracting or dangerous is happening simultaneously that routine movements through a ship or station become potentially problematic.

#### MOVING IN MICROGRAVITY GM INTRUSIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 39)

Moving in Microgravity GM Intrusions

|d6|GM Intrusions|
|---|---|
|1|A misjudged jump uses too much force and the character takes damage when they hit an unexpected bulkhead or other obstruction, or too little force, leaving them stranded in the middle of an open area.|
|2|A misjudged jump in microgravity causes the character to strike an important control surface that sets off a secondary issue, causes the character to jump to a dangerous location, or causes their tether (apparently previously abraded) to snap and send them spiraling out into space.|
|3|A tool, weapon, or other piece of equipment—even one that should have a tether or magnetic clamp— dislodges and floats away.|
|4|A mishap causes the character to spin wildly, hindering all tasks by two steps from disorientation and nausea. Without outside aid, micro thrusters, or some other useful strategy, stopping a spin is difficult.|
|5|An ally accidentally jostles the character, and they are sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.|
|6|When attempting to grab a resisting target or panicking ally, or after some kind unexpected shake or violent ship maneuver, the character is sent on an unexpected trajectory as if they had misjudged a jump.|

### LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO ZERO G AND RADIATION

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 277)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 38)

In a setting with contemporary tech, a variety of issues related to long-term exposure to micro-gravity and high radiation beset astronauts, including bone and muscle loss, less circulating blood and red cell mass, less ability to constrict and dilate in vessels, irregular hormones, diminished immune system, inability of mitochondria to initiate wound healing, and even shortened telomeres. The inability to heal even minor wounds and nicks until a space-farer returns to stronger gravity will eventually prove lethal, though a snapped bone or normally inconsequential virus or parasite could also do them in.

#### SPACE HEALTH HAZARD GM INTRUSIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 38)

Space Health Hazard GM Intrusions

|d6|GM Intrusions|
|---|---|
|1|Space sickness happens to everyone eventually. Nauseated characters are hindered in all tasks and may vomit unexpectedly.|
|2|A wrist bone, thinner than it should be due to long-term exposure to microgravity, breaks.|
|3|Upon return to full gravity after a long period in zero G or low G, the character stands up and then passes out. (This "orthostatic intolerance" fades in a few hours.)|
|4|Vision becomes distorted because the character's eyes literally take on a new shape in zero G, all vision-related tasks are hindered.|
|5|Despite precautions, sometimes viruses infect a character. The common cold virus is, ridiculously enough, still not preventable in advanced settings, and if anything, has even more severe symptoms for those in microgravity. The character descends one step on the damage track until they get better.|
|6|The character is diagnosed with cancer. Depending on the tech setting, it is amenable to medical intervention (or at least long-term treatment to keep symptoms controlled), if that intervention comes soon enough.|

### SPACE SUITS ARE FALLIBLE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 37)

Even if advanced tech or fantastic tech is available, space suits are susceptible to all kinds of mishaps. Of course, that's especially true for contemporary tech space suits, which work hard at keeping a constant internal air volume so that a wearer doesn't have to continually exert themselves to hold the suit in a given position or pre-breathe oxygen at a higher concentration. "Hard-shell" suits manage this with multiple joints and segments that shift on ball bearings, and by being able to maintain a higher internal pressure than soft suits.

#### SPACE SUIT GM INTRUSIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 37)

Space Suit GM Intrusions

|d6|GM Intrusions|
|---|---|
|1|An ill-fitted suit (or one whose auto-fit function is malfunctioning) unexpectedly hinders the character's action.|
|2|Mechanical joints in the suit freeze unexpectedly, hindering all the character's actions (or completely paralyzing the character) until repairs can be made.|
|3|A stuck valve causes the drinking water bulb to get stuck "on" and water begins filling the helmet. This could blind and/or drown the character if not dealt with.|
|4|Space sickness/a tumble/a spin nauseates the character. If they vomit in their helmet, they are blinded until such time as the helmet can be removed and cleaned.|
|5|An electrical short from an external tool or piece of hardware fries the space suit's electronics, limiting communication to helmet-to-helmet touch (if in a vacuum where sound doesn't propagate), use of micro thrusters, and limits air supply to just a quarter of what was previously available.|
|6|A bloated suit from an overpressure incident hinders all tasks, but is not lethal … until the suit won't quite fit back into the airlock.|

#### TAKING DAMAGE IN A SPACE SUIT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 71)

Taking damage while protected from the effects of vacuum in a space suit (or safesuit) requires one additional defense roll. On a failure, the suit breaches and begins to spew precious air, heat, and pressure into the void.

### EFFECTS OF VACUUM

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 277)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 36)

Vacuum is lethal. There's no air to breathe, and the lack of pressure causes havoc on an organic body. An unprotected character moves one step down the damage track each round. However, at the point where they should die, they instead fall unconscious and remain so for about a minute. If they are rescued during that time, they can be revived. If not, they die.

#### VACUUM GM INTRUSIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 36)

Vacuum GM Intrusions

|d6|GM Intrusions|
|---|---|
|1|The character notices a crack in their space suit or ship. It's not breached now, but may soon become a serious problem.|
|2|A breach in another part of the ship or space station causes automatic safety pressure baffles to close that section off. A character might be caught in that area of the ship, or in an area of a descending baffle, which inflicts serious damage on the character (these things are made to resist obstructions and form a seal).|
|3|A previously unknown crack in a space suit or ship begins to leak. It doesn't cause a blow-out, but unless the crack can be repaired or sealed, those affected will eventually be exposed to vacuum.|
|4|A catastrophic blow-out exposes the character or characters to vacuum. It may also send them spiraling out into the void, depending on the situation.|
|5|Vacuum exposure causes the character to projectile vomit, effectively rendering them unable to take an action on their next turn.|
|6|Vacuum exposure causes the character to go temporarily blind, which is only relieved a few minutes after normal atmosphere is restored.|

## SPACE HAZARDS

### QUICK REFERENCE: SPACE HAZARDS

- Asteroid/Debris Field (SF, 58)
- Black Hole (SF, 57)
- FTL Instability (SF, 58)
- Gravity Well (SF, 56)
- Radiation Belt/Solar Flare (SF, 57)
- Spatial Anomaly (SF, 59)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 56)

A few specific hazards that you can include as part of an encounter involving a spacecraft follow.

### GRAVITY WELL

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 56)

All bodies in space produce a gravitational field, though usually only things the size of a small moon or larger pose a hazard to unprepared (and sometimes even to prepared) spacecraft. The larger the body, the "deeper" and wider the associated gravity field. Any time a spacecraft launches from a moon or planet, it must escape the gravity well. For RPG purposes, that's either a routine task, or a low-difficulty one (assuming no complicating factors are at play).

Gravity wells become a hazard when a spacecraft encounters one unexpectedly— usually because of a navigational or sensor error, but occasionally because of a moon or extreme gravity source being someplace unforeseen.

- **Slingshot Trajectory:** An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can sling a spacecraft off on a new and unwanted trajectory on a failed piloting task, the difficulty determined by the situation.
    
- **Captured:** An unexpected encounter with a gravity well can also capture a spacecraft in the gravity well's orbit, forcing the craft to expend additional power to get free (power it may or may not have).
    

### BLACK HOLE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 57)

Black holes are just extreme gravity wells. All the dangers associated with a gravity well also apply to black holes. A couple of additional hazards are also associated with black holes, notably tidal destruction ("spaghettification"), time dilation, and being swallowed.

- **Tidal Destruction:** Mechanically speaking, while a spacecraft feels tidal forces by passing too close to a black hole's event horizon, all tasks aboard the craft are hindered, Void Rules are in effect, and if a GM intrusion is triggered thereby, the ship sustains major damage and risks coming apart. Meanwhile, PCs in the ship (assuming some sort of fantastic tech-rated gravity nullifier isn't in use) suffer 1 point of ambient damage each round.
    
    A ship near a very large black hole (like Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy) can avoid tidal effects because the gravity gradient is so much wider, but still feel relativistic time dilation.
    
- **Relativistic Time Dilation:** From a mechanical perspective, spacecraft that survive close encounters with black holes and return to normal space discover that more time has passed than expected, which could range from fairly inconsequential minutes or hours, to far more serious days, months, years, centuries, or more.
    
- **Past the Event Horizon:** The event horizon is the point of no return, where not even light can escape the clutch of gravity. If a spacecraft falls into a black hole, assuming it is not spaghettified by tidal forces, it is still lost from the universe of its origin. At least, it's lost assuming no intervention from a fantastic tech-rated post-singularity AI or ancient ultra.
    

### RADIATION BELT/SOLAR FLARE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 57)

Radiation belts of intensely charged particles trapped by magnetic fields around some planets and moons can surge, causing radiation exposure. An unexpected solar flare, or the drive plume of a massive spacecraft, can cause the same unexpected exposure.

- **Ship Damage:** The ship suffers minor or major damage, requiring repair and perhaps even replacement of parts. This damage is as serious as you require for the purposes of creating an interesting story.
    
- **Radiation Sickness:** When PCs are exposed to intense radiation, they suffer 3 points of ambient radiation damage for each minute the character fails a difficulty 3 Might defense task. If the character fails three such defense rolls during any single period of radiation exposure, they suffer acute radiation sickness, a level 8 disease that drops them one step on the damage track for each day they fail a Might defense roll until they expire.
    

### ASTEROID/DEBRIS FIELD

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 58)

Movies often depict asteroid belts as densely packed fields of tumbling rock that ships must constantly swerve through to avoid a collision. Such locations are not easy to find in the solar system. But such situations can occur in fantastic settings, or possibly in solar systems other than Earth's.

- **Evasive Asteroid Piloting:** During any round a spacecraft moves through a densely packed asteroid or debris field, the pilot (or ) must succeed on a piloting task, whose difficulty is set by the situation. On a failed roll, a collision occurs. Each time a collision occurs, the ship (and possibly its crew) is damaged according to the track laid out below. Collisions are assumed to be major rocks or pieces of debris, or possibly a series of smaller pieces of debris all impacting nearly simultaneously, with one getting through the shielding.
    
- **Finding Shelter:** The best way to find shelter in order to effect repairs, or hide from pursuers, is to try to find an asteroid or piece of debris large enough for the spacecraft to land on or find a crevice to slide into. To land a spacecraft on an asteroid or big piece of debris is a challenging (difficulty 5) piloting task to match the asteroid's spin, then slide into the cramped space.
    

#### SHIP COLLISION DAMAGE TRACK

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 58)

Ship Collision Damage Track

|Number of Collisions|Effect|
|---|---|
|1–3|One or more of the spacecraft's weapons are disabled until repaired|
|4–6|Spacecraft's drive is hampered; all piloting tasks are hindered until repaired; crew takes 2 points of damage|
|7|Spacecraft suffers a blow-out into vacuum in one of its compartments; affected crew must succeed on difficulty 5 tasks to hold on and face vacuum exposure|
|8|Spacecraft suffers general life support failure; all crew not in suits face vacuum exposure|
|9|Spacecraft cannot alter its present course; all piloting tasks fail until drive repaired; crew takes 4 points of damage|
|10|Spacecraft is completely destroyed|

### FTL INSTABILITY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 58)

Even though many different kinds of faster-than-light options are available, any use of FTL in a setting faces similar sorts of hazards at three different points: when first entering FTL, while in FTL transit, and when exiting FTL.

- **Entering FTL:** Whether engaging warp drive or passing into the mouth of a wormhole gate, complicating factors might require a piloting roll, with the difficulty determined by the situation. On a failed roll, any number of bad outcomes are possible, though the least dramatic is that the craft simply fails to enter FTL and cannot do so until the PCs determine the reason and rectify it.
    
- **In FTL Transit:** A dark drive failure or some weird instability in a wormhole throat, or some other issue during FTL transit could occur. Usually, these instabilities are not something a pilot can avoid, because they should be presented as a GM intrusion, at which point the PCs can attempt to avoid or deal with the situation.
    
    Instability could result in a spacecraft dropping out of FTL only partway to the destination, dropping out in some completely unrecognized part of space, dropping out at the right place but months or years late, or failing to drop out at all and thus continue to move through the abnormal spaces that FTL transit posits.
    
    Alternatively, enemy ships—or creatures—might use some sort of fantastic technology to attack a PC's craft while in FTL transit, which might force the craft back into normal space, or result in a firefight in the abnormal folded space of FTL itself (probably even more dangerous than regular combat, depending on your setting's version of FTL).
    
- **Exiting FTL:** The same sorts of complications could bedevil a craft exiting FTL as when entering. If so, a piloting roll is required. However, on a failed roll, results include a collision (use the Ship Collision Damage Track provided under the Asteroid/Debris Field space hazard), an inadvertent spray of high-energy particles from abnormal space acting as a particle cannon accidentally aimed at some other craft or space station at the destination location, or creating/falling into a spatial anomaly.
    

### SPATIAL ANOMALY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 59)

Finally, hard-to-categorize irregularities in space-time go by the broad term of "spatial anomaly." Most of the time, spatial anomalies are hazards found in fantastically-themed settings, but not always. Because these things are anomalous, no one set of guidelines can fit them all. That said, spatial anomalies are usually a side-effect of some other factor at play, such as a hidden black hole, a dimensional rift, or the distortion field surrounding a range of post-singularity AIs estivating in the gravity wall of a magnetar.

Generally speaking, spatial anomalies are a few light-seconds up to a few light-years across. It's difficult for spacecraft to navigate within spatial anomalies, and they face many challenges if they attempt to (or are forced to) do so.

- Ranged Weapons (SF, 85)
- Vehicles (SF, 92)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 272)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 65)

In a science fiction setting, the following items (and anything else appropriate to the setting) are usually available.

- **Equipment:** Equipment includes apparel, armor, cybernetic implants, personal drone assistants, and other items that, for the most part, can be easily transported. Technically speaking, armaments are also equipment. Unless it's important to make a distinction, assume all guidance regarding "equipment" also applies to armaments. But when it is important to make a distinction, the term "armaments" is used for equipment that is also a weapon.
    
- **Armaments:** From contemporary bullet-firing pistols to fantastically advanced handheld disintegration guns, the weapons presented in this chapter are dedicated to those that a single character can carry and use.
    

### VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 65)

Equipment costs assume the setting is predominantly of same tech rating as the object's tech rating. The price drops by one price category if the setting tech rating is, generally speaking, greater than the object's tech rating.

Note, however, that inexpensive items do not become free; they remain inexpensive.

### WEAPON OPTIONS GRANTED BY TYPE OR FOCUS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 65)

When a player makes up their character, their type likely indicates that they can choose one or more weapons of their choice. When choosing such weapons and equipment, the following restrictions apply to that choice:

- Characters must choose weapons within, or less than, the average tech rating of the setting.
- Characters may not choose weapons in the exorbitant or priceless price category.

### CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 66)

Equipment listed as contemporary can often be had in hard science fiction or fantastic genres, possibly at a lower price. Note that such equipment available in these future worlds are not necessarily antiques (though they could be), but rather cheaply made objects.

### EQUIPMENT POWER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 66)

For the most part, assume that equipment is either self-powered, or easily powered by charging fields or other ubiquitous and freely available sources. That is, unless a piece of equipment losing power makes a good GM intrusion in a clutch situation.

### CUSTOMIZING EQUIPMENT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 66)

Listing all possible armaments and equipment and their many variants across all three tech ratings, at least in the space available, isn't an option. However, a representative cross section is provided. If you're looking for something that isn't noted, look for something close and adapt the listing.

### ADVANCED EQUIPMENT

#### AR CONTACTS4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Expensive × 2
    
- **Details:** As AR glasses, but are lenses fitted to the eye. Also called "smartacs."
    

#### AR GLASSES4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Expensive
    
- **Details:** Sturdy (and sometimes stylish) eyeglasses or goggles provides all the functions of a contemporary smartphone (including communication) and communicator badge, plus is capable of both immersive VR and overlaid HUD and augmented reality functions. Can be worn inside a space suit helmet or incorporated directly into one.
    

#### COMMUNICATOR, BADGE/RING3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Moderate
    
- **Effect:** As satellite phone, but so small it can be worn as a stylish insignia or badge on a cuff, chest, pendant, or carried in a pocket; as a ring worn on a finger, earlobe, or other pierced appropriate or pierced body part; or threaded into a tattoo on wrist or back of hand. Has full voice functionality, including on-the-fly translation (for languages in a network-connected database), and audibly duplicates most smartphone functions.
    
    A communicator badge in the form of ring is often referred to as a data-ring.
    

#### COURIER5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** Essentially a tiny rocket that can exceed human-rated Gs to "quickly" deliver messages across planetary distances if radio (via DSM network), laser, or even graser communication is deemed too susceptible to interception by a third party. A courier must be launched in a micro-gravity environment.
    

#### GRASER ARRAY5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** As laser array, but collimates gamma rays, which diverge far less quickly than light, allowing communication between planets. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).
    

#### LASER ARRAY5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 68)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate. Useful for ship-to-ship communication for "tight" beaming information; even highly focused lasers spread out to several miles after only traveling a few light-seconds, diminishing their usefulness. Also doubles as a spacecraft weapon system (but all attack tasks using it are hindered).
    

### FANTASTIC EQUIPMENT

#### ANSIBLE6 (18)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 69)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** A bulky piece of equipment that takes a few days to set up and calibrate, and which requires enormous power per use, allows instantaneous communication between two points even across interstellar distances.
    

#### MIND'S EYE4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 69)

### ADVANCED ROBOTS AND AI

#### AUTON1 (3)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Moderate
    
- **Details:** The generic term "auton" refers to a smart robot, one able to exist in the world as a full-fledged entity, though not nearly so competent as a true AI. On the other hand, autons come very close to having self-awareness, and some have probably achieved it. The variety of autons is staggering, given that they can be trained in nearly any task. Autons also come in a variety of shapes and colors, which vary based on culture and tech level. Though most can move on treads or legs to follow their owners as directed, some autons are housed in drone-like chassis using either rotors or microthrusters, allowing them to fly rather than move on the ground. Treat a basic auton as a level 1 follower, which allows the auton modifications in one task.
    

#### AUTON, AIDE2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Expensive
    
- **Details:** Treat as a level 2 follower, which allows the auton modifications in up to two tasks, depending on the particular aide.
    

#### AUTON, DEFENSE2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** As auton, but one modification is always Speed defense, which means when helping to defend a target from a physical attack, the target eases the task by two steps. A defense auton also has 3 Armor.
    

#### AUTON, MEDICAL2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Exorbitant

- **Details:** As defense auton or warrior auton, but miniaturized and able to fly in gravity to support owner.
    

#### AUTON, WARRIOR2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** As auton, but one modification is always in attacks, which means when helping a target to make an attack, the target eases the task by two steps. However, warrior autons usually attack autonomously as level 3 entities with a ranged or melee weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage.
    

#### SHIPMIND3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 80)

- **Price:** Exorbitant × 2
    
- **Details:** A shipmind is a sim AI that exists within a single spacecraft or starship, with the ability to control many aspects of vehicle functions as necessary to supplement a crew, or sometimes in lieu of a crew. Shipminds each have their own simulated personality, emulating consciousness, though in most cases, they are not actually conscious. Having a shipmind installed on a spacecraft is immensely helpful, as it can oversee many basic functions. A shipmind usually accomplishes tasks at the level of the ship in which it is installed.
    

### FANTASTIC ROBOTS AND AI

#### SYNTH3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 81)

- **Price:** Expensive
    
- **Details:** Synths are a blend of biological and mechanical parts so advanced that in some cases it's impossible to tell the difference between a living creature and a synth. They are strong AIs in physical bodies. Other varieties of synths are constructed (or have modified themselves) to make it obvious they are not biological. In any case, synths are often sturdier and longer lasting than an average biological entity. Even so, in some settings, synths are relegated to being servitors, as if they were simple robots and autons. In other settings, a few, some, or all humans have long ago migrated into synth bodies, leaving their biology behind in prehistory, and becoming posthuman. Treat as a level 3 follower, which allows the synths modifications in up to three tasks, depending on the particular synth. At minimum, all synths have 2 Armor and regain 1 point of lost health per round if damaged.
    

**Editor's Notes —** See Replicant and Synthetic person.

#### SYNTH, COMPANION4 (12)

### ADVANCED AND FANTASTIC ARMAMENTS

#### ARMAMENT AMMUNITION AND CHARGE

Weapons require ammunition ("ammo"), whether that's rounds of a particular caliber, energy packs, or something even more exotic. You can handle ammo requirements for weapons in one of three ways: exact tracking, abstracted monthly upkeep cost, or not worrying about it.

Exact tracking means asking the character to track their available and used rounds/shots after (and possibly during) a fight.

Abstracted monthly upkeep cost assumes that the characters go through ammo at an average rate, and obtaining more ammo or energy packs is something they do in their "off-camera" time. The monthly upkeep cost for ammo should equal about two steps less in price category than the weapon in question.

Or you can just not worry about keeping track of ammunition, especially in games where gunplay isn't common.

#### ENERGY PACK (50 SHOTS)1 (3)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 83)

- **Price:** Inexpensive
    
- **Details:** Watt-hours (Wh) varies by specific energy weapon, used in most advanced and fantastic ranged weapons.
    

#### SMART ROUNDS (BOX OF 4 ROUNDS)4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 83)

- **Price:** Very Expensive
    
- **Effect:** A smart round can be used to make one normal attack plus up to 3 additional ricochet attacks on targets within short range of the attacker and each other as one action. Each ricochet attack successively increases the GM intrusion range by 2. If a GM intrusion is triggered, the ricochet attack hits something other than what the attacker intended, such as an important system or ally.
    

A character who uses a smart round on a group of foes could attempt to attack up to 4 of them with one shot; however, the GM intrusion range on the last ricochet attack would be 1—7 on the d20.

- Space-Time Vehicles (SF, 112)
- Vehicles as Artifacts (SF, 113)

_See also: Riding or Piloting, Spacecraft, Vehicular Combat, Extended Vehicular Combat, and Bridge Combat._

- **Vehicle:** Technically speaking, spacecraft are also vehicles. Unless it's important to make a distinction, assume all guidance here regarding "vehicles" also applies to spacecraft.
    
- **Spacecraft (and Starship):** When it is important to make a distinction from a simple vehicle restricted to the land, sea, or air of a single planet, the term "spacecraft" is used for vehicles that travel beyond a single planet's atmosphere. Some spacecraft can operate both in space and as planetary vehicles, as noted in their entries.
    

### VARIABLE COST BY TECH RATING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 92)

Vehicle costs assume the setting is predominantly of the same tech rating as the vehicle's tech rating. However, the price might drop by a price category if the setting tech rating is predominantly greater than the vehicle's rating.

- CONTEMPORARY
- ADVANCED
- FANTASTIC

### CONTEMPORARY STYLING IN ADVANCED OR FANTASTIC SETTINGS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 92)

As previously indicated, modern vehicles might be found in settings using advanced or fantastic tech, possibly at a lower price. However, the vehicles available in these future worlds are not (necessarily) antiques, but rather cheaply made objects, possibly with the veneer and stylings of vehicles suitable to the setting, and possibly the power source, too.

### FIGHTING IN A VEHICLE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 93)

If PCs are involved in combat in which they are only partly or lightly enclosed (or not at all enclosed, as in the case of most cycles, boards, and similar conveyances), use normal rules of combat, as modified by vehicular movement. However, if PCs are involved in a combat where they are completely enclosed in a vehicle with no possibility of openness to the environment through which they can fire weapons (so that it's not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles), use the vehicular combat rules.

If PCs are involved in space combat, see the Extended Vehicular Combat rules, which provide all kinds of additional options.

### DRIVERLESS VEHICLES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 93)

If the rider, driver, or pilot activates self-driving as part of another action, riding, driving, and piloting tasks are automatically completed (or failed) according to the vehicle's level, though all such self-driving tasks are hindered. However, the pilot is free to engage in other actions as the vehicle maneuvers to the best of its ability.

This driverless function is also available on many spacecraft, courtesy of a shipmind, which is a sim AI that can control the ship's functions as necessary. Shipminds control spacecraft at the spacecraft's level, not their level, but are not subject to the task hindrance that more basic driverless vehicles suffer.

### LOOKING FOR MORE VEHICLE OPTIONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 94)

A representative cross section of vehicles is provided. If you're looking for something that isn't noted, use something close and adapt the listing.

Also note that unless a particular listing is already indicated as a luxury or sport version, most vehicles can be obtained in a luxury or sports package, either at the next price category up, or at double the indicated price.

### CUSTOMIZING VEHICLES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 94)

Assuming the facilities are available, characters can pay for the customization of their vehicle to add a weapon system, add even more weapon systems, add superior weapons systems, or some other significant option. In most cases, the cost for such an upgrade is very expensive to exorbitant.

### ADVANCED SPACECRAFT

#### MICROCAPSULE2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 108)

- **Price:** Very Expensive
    
- **Details:** As space capsule, but smaller. Limited fusion drive allows movement within a given area of space, but a microcapsule usually doesn't have enough fuel to move between planets. External manipulators allow the pilot to attempt repair and construction tasks without exiting the vehicle.

Travel times across limited interplanetary distances are halved in a racer. Mostly used for competition or as couriers.
    

#### SPACECRAFT, FREIGHTER2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 108)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** A spacecraft designed to haul cargo between planets with a crew up of to 15. Freighter ships may be quite large, or at least haul cargo that is quite large, but these craft are bulky and not meant for quick changes in direction or combat; all maneuvering and combat tasks are hindered. Able to move interplanetary distances with advanced variable dynamic ion propulsion. Can land and take off from low-gravity moons and dwarf planets.
    

#### SPACEPLANE2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 108)

- **Price:** Exorbitant

**Torpedos in space combat:** Once launched, self-guiding torpedoes engage smart-tracking systems to zero in on their assigned targets. The torpedo accelerates at 50 or more Gs towards its target, but at the extended distances in which many space battles occur, it may still take several rounds for a torpedo to finally home in on and strike (or ultimately miss) its target.

#### SPACECRAFT, SOLAR SAIL2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 109)

- **Price:** Exorbitant
    
- **Details:** A spacecraft designed for long-haul research expeditions around the solar system with a crew of up to five or six, with individual pods designed for induced hibernation during double or triple normal travel times to extend provisions to last several years or longer.

#### SKYHOOK6 (18)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 109)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** Heavy rotating space station orbiting a moon or planet that extends two massive tethers opposite each other, so that one tether periodically dips deep into the atmosphere close to the surface. At this point, payloads are hooked to the end of the cable as the tether passes, and are then flung into orbit by the station's massive rotation. The skyhook can decelerate and safely de-orbit other payloads in the same way.
    

#### SPACE ELEVATOR7 (21)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 110)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** Tether anchored to the surface of a moon or planet that extends into space along which vehicles can travel, granting access to and from orbital space. A counterweight space station exists at the far end of the tether in what is essentially geostationary orbit.

#### STARSHIP, DISCOVERY CLASS5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 110)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** A large research starship with quarters for crew and staff of up to 150 or more people.

Data wafers contain encrypted personalities (human and/or AI) capable of gathering data on target solar systems after relative travel times of months (but decades in objective time).
    

### STELLAR GATES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 111)

Stellar gates open wormholes between two fixed points at different locations without crossing the space between. The complexity of building a stellar gate is so extreme that such technology is often ascribed to found portals and networks dating back to mysterious ancient ultras or by post-singularity AIs. As might be expected, gates have a fantastic tech rating, no matter how small.

#### GATE, GALACTIC6 (18)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 111)

#### GATE, PLANETARY3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 111)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** A free-standing ring or horizontal circular pad up to 9 m (30 feet) in diameter in/over which a spherical event horizon forms, allowing one-way travel to another location on the planet, orbiting moon, or orbiting space station with similar gate structure. Once the event horizon collapses (after several minutes up to an hour), travel back to the original gate is possible by initiating a second event horizon, though power reserves usually take several hours or more to build up to support each new wormhole opening.
    

#### GATE, STAR5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 111)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** As planetary gate, but four times as large and connects gate structures that lie between locations within a few thousand light-years.
    

### SPACE-TIME VEHICLES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 112)

Space-time vehicles are so complex that it's likely they are the product of ancient ultras or post-singularity AIs, and could be treated as artifacts with a depletion of 1 in 1d20.

#### CAR, TEMPORAL/DIMENSIONAL7 (21)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 112)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** As contemporary utility car or sports car, but once moving can transition into another preset dimension or time. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.
    

#### MATRIX, TEMPORAL8 (24)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 112)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** An arbitrarily shaped vehicle or structure, bigger on the inside than out, that allows a pilot to travel into different locations in time and space, though arbitrary destinations are sometimes achieved despite apparent navigation successes by the pilot. Enormous power requirements require recharge period of several days between each use.
    

### VEHICLES AS ARTIFACTS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 113)

Cypher System artifacts in a science fiction setting could potentially be any one of the vehicles presented in this chapter, if found by characters in a less advanced setting than its tech rating. That said, even in advanced or fantastic settings, opportunities to find especially weird and hard-to-grok objects are everywhere.

A couple of examples of such artifacts are presented here.

#### FRACTAL TRAVELER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 113)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Goggle-like device of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** When worn, induces a powerful hallucinogenic state in wearer. Hallucinations last for four hours, during which time the wearer seems to disappear from existence. From the wearer's perspective, they are falling through an ever-iterating fractal realm of mind-blowing imagery, possibly some version of hyperspace or dark energy network. At the end of that period they return to existence, either in the same location they left or somewhere they've previously visited. The images leave the viewer shaken, but for several hours all Intellect-based tasks are eased.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

#### GATE RING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 113)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Wearable ring of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** Creates a full-sized shield that can be used as a regular shield in combat for one character, providing an asset on Speed defense rolls for the duration of that combat, after which it returns to its ring-like form. In addition, the wielder can command the deployed shield to become a functioning star gate that remains open for just one hour, leading to a strange destination (which the wielder is potentially aware of, if they ran sufficient analysis on the ring or otherwise gained information about it before using the function).
    
- **Depletion:** Automatic (if gate is formed)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 103)

- Most spacecraft have the capacity to reach orbit from the surface of the planet, if not radically more advanced capabilities. All spacecraft completely enclose their crew in a sealed cabin (or series of chambers) with life support suitable for days, weeks, or much longer. Most spacecraft also come with one or more spare space suits, tools, a few spare parts, and so on. Advanced and fantastic spacecraft also have sensors that provide enough astronavigation information to plot and fly to their destinations.
    
    Advanced spacecraft have advanced propulsion technologies, allowing them to move between planets within a single solar system, with transit times between planets varying from days to weeks (or more, if using a less efficient drive). Most advanced spacecraft can't land on a planet's surface unless noted, requiring some secondary craft or means to transfer crew and cargo.
    
    PCs in spacecraft can travel to other moons, planets, space stations, and perhaps even other solar systems. PCs in spacecraft may also get caught up in space combat (see the Extended Vehicular Combat rules) and run across space hazards.
    
- **Starcraft:** "Starships" are spacecraft that have FTL technology, allowing them to move between different stars, with transit times ranging from days to months, or years in extreme cases. Starships are also often capable of planetary landings and ascent with some retrofitting before each planetfall.
    

#### SAMPLE STARSHIPS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

Here are a few sample starship types:

Starship Types

|Starship|Level|Crew|Weapon Systems|
|---|---|---|---|
|Fighter|1|1|1|
|Interceptor|2|1|1|
|Freighter|3 (4 for defense)|4|1|
|Frigate|4|20|4|
|Cruiser|4|25|5|
|Battleship|10|1,000|36|

"Crew" indicates the minimum number of people needed to operate the ship. Many ships can carry more passengers. "Weapon Systems" indicates the maximum number of different enemies the ship can target at once—but only one attack per target in any circumstance.

Since it's frighteningly easy to die in a space battle if your ship is destroyed, most ships have escape pods. Even fighter craft have ejection systems that put the pilot out into space in an environment suit. In other words, GMs should try to give PCs a way out of immediately dying if they get on the wrong end of a space battle.

### TRAVELING THE SOLAR SYSTEM AND ORBITAL MECHANICS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 277)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 104)

In a hard science fiction setting, you might be interested in evoking the reality of travel times between colonies on planets and moons in the solar system. Even so, plotting a course between locations in the solar system isn't simple, because everything is always moving with respect to everything else. You could determine exactly how long a trip would take with some internet research. Or you could just evoke the effect of orbital mechanics and varying accelerations on interplanetary travel. Use the Interplanetary Travel Table to do so. For a trip between locations not directly compared, add up the destinations in between. The travel times assume a nuclear plasma engine of a kind already being tested today (but better), a steady thrust toward the destination, and an equally long and steady braking thrust over the last half of the trip before orbit insertion. Such propulsion systems can change velocity and sustain thrust for days at a time, which reduces bone loss, muscle atrophy, and other long-term effects of low gravity.

Regardless, the travel times between distant locations bring home one thing: space is big and lonely.

#### SOLAR SYSTEM TRAVEL TIMES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 104)

Solar System Travel Times

|Origin|Destination|Travel Time Using Nuclear Plasma Engine|
|---|---|---|
|Venus|Mercury|20 +120 days|
|Earth/moon|Venus|20 +1d20 days|
|Earth/moon|Mars|20 +1d20 days|
|Mars|Asteroid Belt|30 +1d20 days|
|Asteroid Belt|Jupiter and its moons|30 +1d20 days|
|Jupiter|Saturn and its moons|60 +1d20 days|
|Saturn|Uranus|90 +1d20 days|
|Uranus|Neptune|100 +1d20 days|
|Neptune|Pluto|100 +1d20 days|

### LIGHTSPEED COMMUNICATION DELAY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 67)

For ease of reference, the light delay table provides the time it takes light from the sun to each planet in our solar system, plus a few other notable locations. To figure light delays between two different locations, subtract the time delay of the object closer to the sun from the time delay of the object farther away. The difference is the light delay between those two locations. Double times for two-way communication:

Lightspeed Communication Delay

|Location|AU|Light Delay|
|---|---|---|
|Mercury|0.4|3 minutes|
|Venus|0.7|6 minutes|
|Earth|1.0|8 minutes|
|Mars|1.5|13 minutes|
|Asteroid belt|2.7|22 minutes|
|Jupiter|5.2|43 minutes|
|Saturn|9.5|79 minutes|
|Uranus|19|160 minutes|
|Neptune|30|4 hours|
|Inner Kuiper Belt|30|4 hours|
|Pluto|39|6 hours|
|Outer Kuiper Belt|50|7 hours|
|Inner Oort Cloud|5k|29 days|
|Outer Oort Cloud|100k|19 months|
|Proxima Centauri|269k|4.2 years|

### SPACECRAFT UPKEEP

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 103)

Each month of spacecraft operation usually requires that the PCs pay for fuel, feedstocks, and other upkeep. The level of the spacecraft determines upkeep.

Spacecraft Upkeep

|Level|Upkeep Cost|
|---|---|
|1-2|Moderate|
|3-5|Expensive|
|6-7|Very expensive|
|8-9|Exorbitant|
|10|Priceless|

### RETROFITTING POWER AND DRIVES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 104)

Older spacecraft and starships are often retrofitted with more advanced power sources, and more importantly, FTL drives, in order to give them the ability to move further. The main reason to do this is that such ships cost much less, especially if retrofitted advanced ships are available in a fantastic setting, but even for craft within the same tech rating. During vehicular combat, retrofitted ships are treated as if 1 level lower than their actual level for purposes of level comparison in combat if they are fighting FTL-capable fantastic-rated starships.

#### CONTEMPORARY POWER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 104)

- **Solar Panels:** Usually flat panels that convert sunlight to electricity, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives.
    
- **RTGs:** When solar panels are not an option, as is often the case for spacecraft that operate far from the sun or on a planetary surface with lots of dust or shadow, RTGs (radioisotope thermoelectric generators) are good long-term power sources for electric power, which can be used for a variety of onboard systems, including powering ion drives. The heart of an RTG is an embedded mass of atomic isotope, such as plutonium-238.
    

#### CONTEMPORARY DRIVES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 104)

- **Rocket:** A rocket engine produces thrust by expelling reaction mass, usually in thundering expanding white clouds from the rocket's base propulsion nozzle. Most contemporary spacecraft use a mix of several rockets and fuel types. Rockets are the primary constituent of a heavy-lift launch spacecraft.
    
- **Ion Thruster:** Ion thrusters can use solar panels or RTGs (or both) to expel ions (or cations) to produce thrust over long periods, which allows a spacecraft to build up speed over large periods of time. The bleeding edge of contemporary ion thruster is VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket), which could drastically reduce travel times around the solar system, if perfected.
    

#### ADVANCED POWER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 105)

- **Fusion Power:** Electrical generation by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions, requiring relatively small fuel input for much higher-power output. Fuel sources include helium-3 (abundant on the Moon and other locations in the solar system without an atmosphere).
    

#### ADVANCED DRIVES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 105)

- **Nuclear Plasma:** Essentially, nuclear plasma drives are just very advanced ion thrusters, the promised "perfected" version. These are great, unless the setting has fusion drives, in which case nuclear plasma drives may seem quaint.
    
- **Fusion Drive:** Relying on fusion power, a fusion drive is an order of magnitude more efficient than a contemporary ion thruster. A fusion drive does not require the creation of electricity to ionize propellent, but instead directly uses the fusion product as an exhaust to provide thrust.
    

#### FANTASTIC POWER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 105)

- **Antimatter Power:** Antimatter particles have opposite charge from their matter counterparts, giving them potentially explosive properties when combined, producing energy an order of magnitude more than a fusion power system. Fuel sources include both antimatter as well as Li2 (an atom with 2 lithium ions), important for controlled matter-antimatter reaction so it can be harnessed for power.
    
- **Singularity Power:** Taps energy from Hawking radiation and rotational energy of a spinning micro-black hole to generate energy an order of magnitude more than nuclear power. Fuel source is a micro-black hole.
    
- **Zero-Point Generator:** Vacuum energy is created by normal fluctuation in the quantum field of normal space-time. This zero-point radiation of the vacuum provides arbitrary (possibly limitless) amounts of energy with no fuel other than the initial resources required to build the generator.
    

#### FANTASTIC DRIVES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 105)

- **Warp Drive:** A warp drive uses enormous power to distort the fabric of space-time to create a bubble surrounding the starship. The bubble moves by compressing space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it, moving independently of the rest of the universe to achieve apparent FTL travel. Warp drives can achieve objective speeds of up to 500 times the speed of light at maximum power.
    
- **Hyperdrive:** Similar to warp drive in some ways, but pushes the ship into a different realm of existence, often called hyperspace, where laws of physics differ significantly and many more dimensions are accessible, allowing a ship to greatly surpass the speed of light before returning to normal space. Hyperdrives can achieve objective speeds of up to 1000 times the speed of light at maximum power.
    
- **Wormhole Drive:** A wormhole drive uses enormous power to open a shortcut between two locations in space-time and travel between those points in a matter of seconds. Most wormhole drives rely on regions of space where wormholes can be formed, or on previously established networks of wormhole tunnels that the wormhole drive accesses. Which means that while travel between two points might be almost instantaneous, travel to and from wormhole-viable locations could greatly increase travel times. Likewise, wormholes can normally only bridge locations up to 200 or so light-years at a time (which means it would take about 500 jumps to cross the Milky Way galaxy from end to end).
    
- **Dark Drive:** A dark drive (short for "dark matter quantum drive") uses enormous power to enable point-to-point transitions between other locations in the galaxy (or universe) using previously unrealized entanglement between normal matter and dark matter. However, objective travel time is variable and somewhat arbitrary; sometimes a trip may take minutes, other times days or months. For those aboard, relative travel time seems constant at about four solar hours, no matter the distance traveled, or the objective time noted by external observers.
    

### PILOTING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 44)

Many spacecraft have only a single system and dedicated station for piloting and navigation, suitable for a single PC to crew, though a larger craft could split those duties. A PC piloting a ship during combat can attempt any number of piloting tasks, as well as any other type of flying that they deem necessary. While not in combat, the PC crewing this station pilots the ship from place to place in space.

**A successful piloting defense task is not always a miss:** A failed enemy attack doesn't always mean it misses a character's craft. The PC's spacecraft might rock and reel from the hit, but the bulk of the damage was absorbed by the hull or shields, so there's no significant damage.

#### PILOTING TASKS

Piloting Tasks

|Piloting Task|Hindrance|Effect on Target Craft|
|---|---|---|
|Evasive maneuvers|One step|Defenses eased three steps, but attacks this round hindered by the same amount|
|Increase separation|One step|Defenses eased one step, attacks hindered by one step, but creates chance to lose enemy aircraft (see below)|
|Decrease separation|—|Negates chance of losing enemy craft this round|
|Stealth approach|Three steps|So long as no attack is made, pilot's craft can 'snug' up to much larger enemy craft and hide from its sensors|
|Lose enemy craft|Four steps|If separation is first increased as a separate task (or maneuverability is disabled), target craft loses track of pilot's craft behind a moon, in a debris belt, _etc._|
|Study enemy flying|—|Spend one round watching enemy tactics, the next piloting task is eased|
|Fly in formation|—|If another allied ship is part of the combat, coordinate with it, providing that ship an asset in its next piloting task|
|Redline maneuver|—|Spinning, flying through a dangerous region, or some other gamble|

### SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 45)

A spacecraft may have more than one science and engineering system. Each science and engineering system has a station, each of which can be crewed by a separate PC. A spacecraft can potentially attempt as many science and engineering tasks each round as stations systems it possesses, if each one is crewed.

#### SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING TASKS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 49)

Science and Engineering Tasks

|Science and Engineering Task|Hindrance|Effect on Target Craft (or on PC's craft)|
|---|---|---|
|Scan|—|Gain basic information, such as whether other ships are in the area, if such ships are in yet within combat range, if reinforcements might be in the offing, and so on|
|Tactical scan|One step|Learn the level of identified enemy spacecraft|
|Deep scan|Two steps|Enemy spacecraft weakness discovered, next task chosen by this character for another PC is eased (usually a piloting or weapons task)|
|Jam/Hack|Two steps|Requires three success before two failures (thus a minimum of three rounds); if successful, enemy ship takes no actions for a couple of rounds until they regain control by severing the communications link; during this time, all tasks against enemy craft are eased by two steps|
|Open communications|Two steps|Attempt to parlay; at the very least, success causes the enemy spacecraft to delay at least one round, which could be the end of it, or open further dialogue|
|Reconfigure station|—|Changes the system that the station controls. Useful when another station is damaged or the PC crewing another station is disabled; reconfiguration locks out options from whatever system is previously controlled unless reconfigured again; can be done as part of another action|
|Effect repair|—|Sometimes a character can repair a subsystem from their station, but repair may require moving to another part of the ship, such as the drive chamber, the compartment where weapons are sleeved, or even onto the outer hull. The difficulty is equal to the modified difficulty of the enemy craft that caused the damage.|
|Redline science/engineering|—|Reverse polarity on the sensors, dig up some bizarre lore from a database that could change the situation somehow, make the hull reflective, or some other risky gambit|

### WEAPON SYSTEM

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 44)

A spacecraft may have more than one weapon system. Each individual weapon system has its own station, which can be crewed by a separate PC. Spacecraft systems are considered heavy weapons (which means some characters may be practiced in their use, though others may have an inability). A spacecraft can potentially make as many attacks each round as weapon systems it possesses, if each station is crewed.

#### OPTIONAL: COMMAND

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 45)

Ships with a captain may have a Command station, possibly a captain's chair, though the captain might just crew one of the other stations. Sometimes those with captain's privileges also have the Captain's Calm (SF, 210) special ability. Normally, a captain commanding someone else to do something can't redline; it would be up to the person who received the command whether to try to redline or not, and to face any GM intrusion consequences.

**Editor's Notes —** The Captain's Calm (SF, 210) special ability is not included in the CSRD, but allows a PC to negate GM intrusions triggered by their crewmates on a limited basis.

## EXTENDED VEHICULAR COMBAT

### QUICK REFERENCE: EXTENDED VEHICULAR COMBAT

- Base Combat Task Modifiers (SF, 40)
- Redline Maneuver (SF, 41)
- Bridge Combat (SF, 43)
- Vehicles Fighting Creatures (SF, 47)
- Salvage from a Spacecraft (SF, 56)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 39)

When vehicular combat occurs—which happens whenever the PCs are completely enclosed in a vehicle so that it's not really the characters fighting, but the vehicles—start with the vehicular combat rules.

However, if you'd like to provide the PCs with more options designed especially for spacecraft combat, use these optional rules instead, which include a "redline maneuver" system for trying extremely risky spacecraft maneuvers, bridge combat options, and more. The base vehicular combat rules have been integrated into these extended rules, so you don't need to continually cross-reference them to understand how it all works.

In extended vehicular combat, PCs on a spacecraft take actions on their turn, just like in a standard Cypher System combat encounter. Use standard initiative rules to determine when PCs take their actions, and when enemy spacecraft take theirs. Characters will be crewing specific spacecraft system stations described under Bridge Combat, and thus could attempt a piloting maneuver, to fire the ship weapons, to scan the enemy craft for weaknesses, or to attempt some similar spacecraft operation task on their turn. Alternatively, they might be somewhere else on the ship attempting repairs, fighting off boarders, attempting to open communications in order to negotiate, or taking some other action.

For their part, enemy spacecraft are likely to fire on the same systems aboard a PCs' spacecraft as the ones the PCs are firing on (weapons, defenses, engines, or even a kill shot). The PC pilot rolls one or more defense rolls. The enemy spacecraft faces the same modifications the PCs face when targeting a particular system (as described hereafter), except those modifications ease or hinder the PC making the defense roll, since NPC craft never roll themselves. And, if an enemy ship manages to disable a system on the PCs' ship on an attack, PCs can attempt repair tasks to get those systems back online on their turns.

The main difference between spacecraft combat and regular combat is that the difficulty of tasks that the PCs attempt in relation to the enemy craft varies a lot more than in regular combat. In normal combat, a task difficulty is usually equal to the foe's level. But in spacecraft combat, a task difficulty is equal to a modified task difficulty (beginning with the spacecraft's level, but moving on from there, as noted hereafter). The modified difficulty always applies to anything characters attempt in regard to the enemy spacecraft, whether a PC fires at an enemy ship, dodges return fire, attempts to scan the enemy spacecraft, attempts to repair damage caused by the enemy spacecraft, and so on.

It's actually similar to a normal task. For example, when a PC scans a robot, the task difficulty is usually the robot's level, but not always. Sometimes the robot's effective level is modified because of intrinsic skills or systems the robot possesses, or because of something it does making it harder (or easier) for it to be scanned. In the case of spacecraft combat, modification is pretty much a given, and is even more variable. So variable, in fact, that a space combat status tracker has been provided. to turn potentially confusing conflicts into something as easy as looking at a marker to know what the difficulty for a particular task is.

The modifiers that apply, even before PCs attempt a specific combat task noted under Bridge Combat, are as follows.

### BASE COMBAT TASK MODIFIERS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 40)

The following modifiers change the effective level of the enemy of the spacecraft for a given task by hindering or easing a PC's roll. Track each change in effective level on the space combat status tracker.

- **Spacecraft Level Difference:** Compare the levels of the spacecraft involved in the conflict. If the PCs' vehicle has the higher level, the difference in levels becomes a reduction in the difficulty of attack and defense rolls PCs might make. If the PCs' vehicle has the lower level, the difference is an increase in difficulty by the same amount. If the levels are the same, there is no modification.
    
- **Mismatched Tech Rating:** It's possible that vehicles from different tech ratings will fight each other at some point, or become caught up in a larger multi-vehicle fight. When they do, each step difference in tech rating between two opposed vehicles increases the effective level of the higher-rated vehicle by two steps.
    
- **Vehicle Coordination:** If two vehicles coordinate their attack against an enemy vehicle, the attack is eased. If three or more vehicles coordinate, the attack is eased by two steps.
    
- **Superior Weapons, Defenses, or other Systems:** Some vehicles have superior weapons or defenses, as noted in their descriptions. If a vehicle has a superior system, treat that vehicle as if one level higher than its actual level when figuring attacks or evasion tasks if that specific system is involved.
    

#### THE SUPERIORITY OF A WELL-CREWED SPACECRAFT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 42)

A spacecraft with some or all of the PCs crewing different systems stations will be more capable than a regular spacecraft in combat. Which means that an enemy spacecraft that might prove challenging based on its level might actually be fairly easily handled by PCs who fully understand their options.

But be careful, because even competent PCs should fear squadrons of enemy ships, and military craft with several weapon systems. Even a single level difference is magnified, so make sure not to capriciously throw spacecraft at the PCs that are 2 levels higher than their own.

### REDLINE MANEUVER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 41)

When someone with access to spacecraft controls attempts a particularly audacious and risky maneuver, it's a "redline" maneuver. Essentially, declaring a redline maneuver eases one task a PC attempts in a spacecraft under duress, but comes with a concomitant risk.

To make a redline maneuver, a character spends 1 XP as a free action. In doing so, they unlock the option for all the PCs to attempt to redline for rest of the combat. To redline, a PC describes the dangerous thing they want to attempt, then takes that action. Mechanically, the PC eases the particular task they are attempting (which might just be to fire at the enemy craft's weapons), but increases the GM intrusion range by two points.

A character who redlines could opt to increase their gamble by easing a task by two steps or even more; however, each step increases the GM intrusion range by another two points that round.

Redline maneuvers are also available in desperate non-combat situations aboard a spacecraft. For example, Tammie's ship is caught in a decaying orbit over Venus, and the ship doesn't have enough power left to break out. She tells the GM that she's going to try an extremely risky maneuver that involves igniting ALL the remaining power at once, hoping that the explosive thrust will succeed in blowing the craft into a higher orbit. Because things are desperate, she commits to easing the task by two steps after paying 1 XP. This easing (plus any skill, application of Effort, and so on) gives her a pretty decent chance of succeeding, except the GM intrusion range is now 1–5.

If a GM intrusion is triggered, something goes wrong. Remember that success might still be possible if the roll was high enough, but still falls within the increased GM intrusion range.

If you're looking for inspiration for appropriate GM intrusions when a redlining PC triggers one, refer to suggested GM intrusions presented under Bridge Combat hereafter, each associated with a particular ship system that a character is probably crewing.

After any round where a redline maneuver was attempted, the GM intrusion range returns to normal (1 on a 1d20) as the next round beings.

Thus, while PCs do not need to pre-announce their intention to redline at the beginning of each round, coordinating wouldn't be a bad idea. Whichever PC redlines last in a round where redline maneuvers were already attempted could face a fairly significant GM intrusion range.

If Void Rules are also being used and have triggered, redline maneuvers are even more dangerous.

**Multiple Redline Maneuvers:** Only one PC needs to spend 1 XP to unlock redline maneuvers for themselves and for any other PCs aboard the same spacecraft for the duration of a single encounter. Multiple redline attempts during the same round by two or more PCs additively increase the GM intrusion range for that round. So, a PC attempting to redline who takes their turn after previous redline attempts that round faces a GM intrusion range that's already inflated, and which will inflate more when they redline. (PCs who do not redline during a particular round don't have to worry about the increasing GM intrusion range for their action.)

### BRIDGE COMBAT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 43)

If several PCs are aboard the same spacecraft, give them the following option: ask each PC to crew one of the ship system stations, including weapons (of which there could be more than one system, requiring more than one PC to crew them all), piloting, and science and engineering (which could be divided into two stations with similar functionality). A spacecraft generally has a number of system stations equal to its level. PCs on spacecraft that are lower level must flip between system controls as part of another action, using two stations or even just one station for the whole ship. Even if a PC flips a station (reconfigures, as engineers like to say), only a single PC can crew a station (and take an action using it) each round.

When crewing their stations, PCs have several station-specific options available to them. What they do can bears on how the encounter plays out on a round-to-round basis, similar to regular combat. Specific options are provided for each station, but characters are free to attempt other actions they can think of.

The following ship systems might be found on larger spacecraft with room for more than a single pilot.

**Shipmind System Control:** Some ships with integrated AIs (shipminds) can control a particular system autonomously, without a PC. When it acts in this fashion, it can only take a single action each round, which means it could attack and move, but not also attempt a complicated engineering or defensive maneuver. A shipmind acts at a level equal to the overall spacecraft. In addition, shipmind actions against an enemy spacecraft are assessed with the same modifiers for targeting as a PC crewing the station.

#### BRIDGE COMBAT AT THE TABLE

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 46)

Running a combat using these extended rules is straightforward.

- **Know your stuff:** First, familiarize yourself with the material.
    
- **Assign characters a station:** Next, if you have some time to prepare, copy the two-page spread containing the various PC system options, and give one to each player. Tell them to figure out what stations they are crewing, based on the number of systems their ship has (usually no more systems than the level of the ship). You will probably also have to explain the basics.
    
- **Deploy space combat status tracker:** Also make a copy of the one-page space combat status tracker and set it on the table so everyone can see. It'll make a huge difference in how your space combat plays out. The status tracker allows you (and the players) to easily mark the difficulty of current space combat task a PC is attempting, without having to hold all the easing and hindering in your heads, or having to write them out each time.
    
- **Space Combat Status Tracker Instructions:** Using dice (or similar objects) as markers, track the difficulty of the current task that a PC is attempting, as well as the GM intrusion range for that round if any character is attempting to redline. Place the marker in the column appropriate to the kind of task being attempted (attack, defense, or other) at the starting difficulty level. If the PCs face more than one enemy spacecraft, use different colored dice to represent different ships, or separate copies of this status tracker for each additional enemy spacecraft.
    
    At the end of each full round, reset all the markers on the tracker to their base state, unless some effect causes a modification that lasts longer than a round. Be sure to reset the GM intrusion marker, too.
    
- **Roll initiative:** Begin the combat, with the enemy spacecraft of your choice taking on the PCs' ship. Decide whether the enemy spacecraft are already in weapon range (it's your call, we're not tracking that here), and if not, how soon they will be close enough to begin attacking, and let the combat flow.
    

### VEHICLES FIGHTING CREATURES

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 47)

- **Spacecraft vs. Colossal Creatures:** If a creature is as capable as a spacecraft, treat it that way when it comes to vehicular combat. Instead of adjusting for mismatched tech rating, treat the creature's effective level as if three levels less than its actual level. Extrapolate "weapon systems" to the creature's attack methods, defenses to its weird organic plating, and so on. Killing such a creature means taking out its "power core or other vital spot."
    
- **Spacecraft vs. Regular Creatures:** If a vehicle weapon system fires on an unprotected PC (or a PC in a spacecraft fires ship weapons on a creature outside the craft that isn't colossal), it's an entirely different situation. Attacks against a vehicle's systems face all the previously mentioned modifiers. On top of that, add an additional five steps of hindrance to attacks by a regular creature against a starcraft.
    
    Likewise, a PC defending from a spacecraft's attack is hindered by five steps. Except in this case, the spacecraft inflicts damage. Given that ship weapons compared to handheld weapons are an order of magnitude apart when it comes to power, a good rule of thumb is that a spacecraft's weapon inflicts 25 points of damage on a successful hit and knocks the character one step down the damage track. Even if the character succeeds on their defense roll, they still take 5 points of damage.
    

### SALVAGE FROM A SPACECRAFT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 56)

If the derelict ship was subject to vacuum, partly destroyed in combat, or damaged by some other disaster or close encounter with a space hazard, salvaged items are usually degraded, and are valued at one price category less than noted. The GM may decide an object is completely unrecoverable (worthless) or works fine.

**Salvage GM Intrusion:** Claim jumpers/pirates might try to salvage a ship that PCs are attempting to salvage.

Salvage from a Spacecraft

|d10|In-Ship Salvage (value PCs gain on a sale of salvaged item)|
|---|---|
|1|Power core/fuel for drive (expensive)|
|2|Computer core holding core code of a sim AI or strong AI (expensive)|
|3|Cargo— parts, seeds, feedstock for 4d printers, _etc._ (very expensive)|
|4|Food and water stores, 1d6 months (expensive for each month)|
|5|Valuable information encoded in ship systems (variable)|
|6|GM-selected item of health care and nutrition, advanced tech rating (variable)|
|7|GM-selected item of utility gear, advanced tech rating (variable)|
|8|GM-selected item of apparel and armor, advanced tech rating (variable)|
|9|GM-selected robot, advanced tech rating (variable)|
|10|GM-selected armament, advanced tech rating (variable)|

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 89)

Artifacts in a science fiction game can be strange relics from an unknown alien source or tech items that aren't yet widely available. In a galactic setting, for example, it's easy to imagine that innovations or specialized items might not have spread everywhere.

### AMBER CASEMENT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Series of short, rounded tubes and hoses about 12 inches (30 cm) long
    
- **Effect:** The device solidifies the air in a 10-foot (3 m) cube of space, the center of which must be within short range. The air is turned into an amberlike substance, and those trapped in it will likely suffocate or starve.
    
- **Depletion:** 1–4 in 1d6
    

### DIMENSIONAL MODULATOR

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Marble-sized crisscross shape of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** A target within immediate range loses their dimension of breadth (which folds into a higher dimension), rendering them as flat as paper. The target adheres to whatever surface it was attached to, set upon, or was standing upon, and resembles particularly realistic art. An affected creature enters stasis. While in stasis, it is unable to take actions, doesn't age, and is immune to damage and effects. It remains in stasis for about a day, until the user returns the missing dimension or the artifact depletes.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### METABOLIC PROD

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** 1 m (4 foot) metallic rod of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** When touched to a living target (possibly as an attack), the rod injects a potent cocktail of engineered biomolecules, paralyzing the target for up to one minute. The rod wielder may also choose one of the following additional effects, if set before attacking.
    
    - _Aggression:_ The target's aggressive tendencies are increased for one hour, during which time the target attacks almost anything it encounters.
    - _Calm:_ The target's aggressive tendencies are tamped down for one hour, during which time the target responds to attacks but never initiates them.
    - _Hibernation:_ The target falls into hibernation, a coma-like sleep in which their metabolism slows to a crawl. They can go months with no additional food or water and with a fraction of the air they'd normally need. Loud sounds, damage, persistent prodding, and the like wakes someone in hibernation.
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### METABOLISM BUD

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Organic pod, almost like a small, hemispherical bit of brain; once grafted to a host, the host's flesh grows over the pod until it is only a lump
    
- **Effect:** The pod grafts onto any living host (usually near the brain or spine) and injects chemicals that boost the creature's metabolism. This permanently raises the host's Speed Pool maximum by 5 points.
    
- **Depletion:** —
    

### MIND IMAGER

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Handheld device with a plastic panel screen and wires that must be affixed to the head of a creature
    
- **Effect:** This device shows a visual image of what a creature is thinking. The affected creature need not be conscious.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### PROBABILITY REGULATOR

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Fist-sized mathematically perfect solid of constant width of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** For tasks that are usually random, the user exerts some level of control. When picking a card, rolling a die, choosing a number, or otherwise taking an action that skill usually plays no part in, they attempt an Intellect task whose difficulty is determined by how unlikely choosing correctly might be, so long as it is possible, even if unlikely. A 50/50 coin flip is a difficulty of 1, whereas picking a series of numbers with odds around 1 in 300,000,000 is difficulty 10. If successful, they achieve the desired result.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 × task difficulty in 1d20
    

### PSYCHIC CRYSTAL

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Violet crystal the size of a fist
    
- **Effect:** The crystal allows the user to transmit their thoughts telepathically at an interstellar distance. Even at that range, communication is instantaneous. Each use allows about a minute's worth of communication, and the communication is entirely one way (so having two crystals would be handy).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### REPAIR SPHERE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 275)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small spherical automaton about 8 inches (20 cm) in diameter
    
- **Effect:** This device comes with a small module that can be affixed to a machine. Floating along, the sphere attempts to follow within immediate range of the module (though it can be directed to remain where it is). It moves a short distance each round. It can come to the module from a range of up to 10 miles (16 km) away. If the module is attached to a machine and that machine takes damage, the sphere moves to repair the damage with sophisticated tools that restore 1d6 − 2 points per round (meaning that if a 1 or 2 is rolled, no damage is repaired that round). This requires no action on the part of the machine being repaired. The sphere can attempt to repair a machine a number of times per day equal to its level. The sphere must be newly activated each day.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### STEORRAFORM

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Badge-sized seven-pointed star of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** If the wearer would become debilitated or die, the worn steorraform prevents it by instantly restoring health (to a creature or an NPC) or points to a Pool (to a player character). If the wearer would die of old age, disease, or poison, the artifact prevents it by rolling back the clock by a few decades, clearing the disease, or denaturing the poison. The artifact is ineffective in preventing death when those conditions last over several rounds or more, such as falling into lava, the sun, a singularity, and so on.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 × number of previous uses in 1d20
    

### SCIENCE FICTION ARTIFACT WEAPONS

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 90)

Artifacts that can be used as weapons, though some have other uses as well.

**Light, Medium, and Heavy Artifact Weapons:** The artifact weapons described in this section are idiosyncratic in that they are not described as light, medium, or heavy. If they were specifically categorized, many characters would find that their training doesn't match up with a particular designation. With artifact weapons living outside the regular weapon categories, anyone can use an artifact weapon.

#### ALPHA BEAM PROJECTOR

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Rifle-like device of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** The device has two settings. One fires a beam of energy that acts as propulsion and rockets the artifact away unless the user can hold onto it as a difficulty 1 Might-based task. A user could use this setting to fly a long distance each round, but doing so requires a difficulty 4 Speed-based task each round to move in the direction desired (and not plow into the ground or the side of a building). The other setting fires a reactionless beam that can be used as a very long-range plasma attack that inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The beam ignores 1 point of Armor from the target.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

#### CARBONIZER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Pistol-like device of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

#### DEATH RAY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Pistol-like device of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** This device fires a beam that transmutes the matter of targets within short range into powdery ash, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level that ignores Armor from force fields and natural scales, leather, and other organic sources.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

#### DISINTEGRATION BEAMER

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Rifle-like device with two electrodelike protrusions of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** This device fires a beam to suppress the charge of the electrons that make up a creature or object within long range, inflicting damage equal to twice the artifact's level. If the attack reduces the target's health (or combined Pools for a PC) to below the level of the artifact, the target instantly falls to dust. (A PC who would be disintegrated can spend 1 XP and instead descend one step on the damage track.)
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

#### EMPATHIC RAY

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Rod-like device with very long barrel of unknown material
    
- **Effect:** This device emits an invisible beam of neural-magnetic energy as a short-range attack that instantly reverses how a level 1 target sees the user (turning an enemy into a friend, and vice versa) for up to one day. The user can adjust the settings to increase the ray's effectiveness by making one additional depletion roll per increase in the maximum level of the target. Thus, to alter the attitude of level 5 target (4 levels above the normal limit), the user must make five depletion rolls. If used against a PC, an affected PC can attempt an Intellect task to end the effect once every minute for the first few minutes, then once every hour.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
