Equipment in the Cypher System plays only a small role. It's far more important to focus on what you can do than on what you have. Still, sometimes it's important to know if you've got enough rope, or what kind of gun your space pilot has at their hip.

## CURRENCY AND PRICES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 201)

Dollars, pounds, euros, credits, gold pieces, Martian solval beads, Corso moons and stars, bottle caps—a lot of different currencies might be used in your game, depending on the setting and the genre. You should use whatever you like. In the Cypher System rules, we talk in generalities rather than specifics. Not unlike saying immediate or short distance rather than giving precise numbers, we talk about goods and services in terms of inexpensive, moderately priced, expensive, very expensive, or exorbitant.

The GM can figure out what those things mean in their setting. In a fantasy setting, an inexpensive item might be 1 or 2 copper pennies, while an expensive item might require gold on the table. The exact amount can vary, and in many campaigns, the exact amount will matter. The GM will develop a detailed price list for their setting, and players will track their money on their character sheets to determine what they can afford, often ignoring the terms inexpensive, moderately priced, and so on.

But some GMs might want to keep things simple and use only the general terms, indicating currency just as flavor now and then. In a space opera game, where the PCs are the crew of a starship blazing about the galaxy in search of adventure and profit, fuel and upkeep for the ship might be expensive. Hauling a few passengers from Epsilon Eridani back to Earth might earn enough to purchase six expensive items but cost the equivalent of two expensive items, leaving the crew with the means to refuel and maintain the ship for two further voyages. In such a game, where money only means keeping the ship flying, no one has to talk in specific amounts. Characters might refer to "galactic credits" or something similar, but amounts might not be tracked on the character sheets.

### PRICE CATEGORIES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

There are five price categories for goods and services.

- **An inexpensive item** is something that common people buy. A simple meal or a drink in the bar. A pen and some paper. A book or magazine.
    
- **A moderately priced item** is something that common people buy, but not too often and not in great quantities. A small piece of furniture. A major entertainment. An expensive meal. A new outfit.
    
- **An expensive item** is something that would strain a common person's finances. Rent on a simple apartment. A major piece of furniture. A very nice outfit. The cost to travel a long distance (if appropriate to the setting).
    
- **A very expensive item** is probably out of the reach of most people except in very special circumstances. Jewelry. Luxury furnishings.
    
- **An exorbitant item** is something only the very rich can afford. A very nice house. A ship. Extremely expensive jewelry or art.
    
- **A priceless item** is something that even the very rich can't afford, requiring the resources of a nation-state, or similar entity appropriate to the setting, to acquire or build.
    

Think of the categories as powers of 10. That is to say, a moderately priced item is ten times more costly than an inexpensive item. An expensive item is ten times more costly than a moderately priced item, and thus 100 times the cost of something inexpensive. A very expensive item is ten times the cost of an expensive one, 100 times the cost of a moderate one, and 1,000 times the cost of an inexpensive one. An exorbitant item is priced ten times beyond that.

In some settings, even the generalization offered by the pricing categories might be too specific or cumbersome. In many superhero games, for example, prices are relatively moot. After saving the city, typical superheroes don't worry about paying rent or how much dinner will cost. On the other hand, in a grittier superhero game, maybe that's exactly what they worry about.

### USING THE PRICE CATEGORIES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

Regardless of how precise you want to be with prices and currency, you can use the price categories in a variety of ways.

It's easy for a GM to say to a player "You can afford two extra moderately priced things at the start of the game." The player can look on the list and pick two moderately priced items without worrying about their cost. Plus, this approach makes it clear that they get two items, not twenty inexpensive items or one more expensive item that perhaps would not be appropriate for a starting character. The categories make it easy to lump similar items together.

The GM can also say "You can have whatever inexpensive items you want, and don't worry about the cost." At higher tiers, when the PCs have more wealth, followers, and so on, the GM can do this with moderate or even expensive items. This allows the group to skip over playing through a shopping trip to get supplies, and players don't have to track prices down to the last coin.

Finally, the categories can be shorthand when evaluating loot, dividing up the spoils among the PCs, and resolving other story-based occurrences that crop up in the game without dealing in the minutiae of exact prices. This is of particular use in high-powered games where the PCs are rich and powerful.

Level of Equipment

 

Mundane equipment is about level 4—less if of inferior quality or materials, more if of superior quality or materials. This means that in a setting based on the distant past, the default level might be 3, while in the future it might be 5 or 6. So an average serf 's tool in the Dark Ages is level 3, easily broken, while an average tool on a space station is level 6, made of advanced polymers.

## ARMOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

Characters expecting danger frequently wear armor. Even the simplest protective covering helps against stabs and cuts, and more sophisticated or heavier armor protects against graver threats.

You can wear only one type of armor at a time—you cannot wear chainmail hauberk and scale armor together, for example. However, Armor bonuses from multiple sources combine to provide a total Armor rating. For example, if you have subdermal implants that give you +1 to Armor, a force field that offers another +1 to Armor, and beastskin that grants +2 to Armor, you have a total of +4 to Armor.

In general, light armor is a moderately priced item, medium armor is expensive, and heavy armor is very expensive. Part 3: Genres offers more specific details on the kinds of armor available in a given setting. Keep in mind that in many genres, it's quite odd, at best, to run around in armor tougher than a leather jacket.

### USING ARMOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

Anyone can wear any armor, but it can be taxing. Wearing armor increases the cost of using a level of Effort when attempting a Speed task.

**Editor's Notes —** This remainder of this section has been amended by the editor for additional clarity.

The following table displays types of armor, the bonus they provide to a PC's Armor characteristic, and the additional cost (in points from their Speed Pool) the PC must spend for each level of Effort used when attempting a Speed task. By default, PCs use the _Not Experienced with Armor_ column. However, if a PC has one or more special abilities that reduce Speed Effort cost for wearing armor—Practiced in Armor, Experienced in Armor, and Mastery in Armor—they can use the corresponding column on the table instead. Reducing the Speed Effort cost for wearing armor is also possible through character advancement.

#### SPEED EFFORT COST PER LEVEL OF EFFORT USED

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

In the game rules, "Speed Effort cost", "Speed cost", "encumbering" and "encumbers" are used interchangeably to refer to the contents of this table.

Speed Effort Cost per Level of Effort Used

|Physical armor|Armor Bonus|Not Experienced with Armor|Practiced in Armor|Experienced in Armor|Mastery in Armor|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Light armor|+1 Armor|+2|+1|0|0|
|Medium armor|+2 Armor|+3|+2|+1|0|
|Heavy armor|+3 Armor|+4|+3|+2|0|

#### EXAMPLE: USING LIGHT ARMOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 202)

Let's say you have the Practiced in Armor ability, you are wearing light armor, and you have a Speed Edge of 1. If you use two levels of Effort on a Speed defense task, it costs 7 points from your Speed Pool: 3 for the first level of Effort plus 2 for the second level of Effort plus 2 for wearing light armor (1 per level of Effort used). Edge reduces the total cost as normal, resulting in a final cost of 6 Speed points.

#### SPECIAL ARMOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 256)

In some genres, there might be super-materials, otherworldly craftsmanship, or other methods that can produce special armor. In a modern setting, light military body armor provides the protection of medium armor, but encumbers the PC as if they are wearing light armor. In a fantasy setting, a shirt of elven chainmail provides the protection of medium armor, but is so light and flexible that it does not encumber the PC any more than normal clothing. In any case, special armor is rare, and worth at least one or two increases to the item's price category, so it probably isn't available at the start of the game.

#### SHIELDS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 143)(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 37)

Shields don't provide a bonus to a character's Armor characteristic. Instead, a shield provides an asset to Speed defense rolls while it is held in one hand. You must have one free hand to use a shield.

**Editor's Notes —** Adept abilities also require a free hand to use unless the GM says otherwise.

## WEAPONS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 203)

Not all characters are familiar with all weapons. Warriors know their way around most types, but Explorers prefer light or medium weapons, and Adepts and Speakers usually stick to light weapons. If you wield a weapon that you have no experience with, an attack with that weapon is hindered. Having experience with a weapon is called being practiced with the weapon.

- **Light weapons** inflict only 2 points of damage, but attacks with them are eased because they are fast and easy to use. Light weapons are punches, kicks, knives, handaxes, darts, very small pistols, and so on. Weapons that are particularly small are light weapons.
    
- **Medium weapons** inflict 4 points of damage. Medium weapons include broadswords, battleaxes, maces, crossbows, spears, typical handguns, light rifles, sawed-off shotguns, and so on. Most weapons are medium. Anything that could be used in one hand (even if it's often used in two hands, such as a quarterstaff or spear) is a medium weapon.
    
- **Heavy weapons** inflict 6 points of damage, and you must use two hands to attack with them. Heavy weapons are huge swords, great hammers, massive axes, halberds, heavy crossbows, rifles, regular shotguns, assault rifles, and so on. Anything that must be used in two hands is a heavy weapon.
    

Weapons

|Weapon|Damage|
|---|---|
|Light|2 points (attack eased)|
|Medium|4 points|
|Heavy|6 points|

In general, light weapons are moderately priced items, medium weapons are expensive, and heavy weapons are very expensive. Ammunition for a ranged weapon is inexpensive. Part 3: Genres offers more specific details on weapons available in a given setting. Keep in mind that in many genres, it's not acceptable to run around carrying dangerous weapons.

**Editor's Notes —** When making melee attacks, the PC can choose to use their Might or Speed for the task. Making ranged attacks is usually a Speed task. This reflects that with melee you sometimes use brute force and sometimes use finesse, but with ranged attacks, it's always about careful targeting.

#### HOUSE RULE: WEAPON PROPERTIES

_This section is based on Weapon Distinctions in the 2015 Cypher System Rulebook (228), paraphrased by the editor._

---

The GM can add additional weapon properties, for example:

- **Slashing:** +1 damage against unarmored targets; −1 damage against armored targets.
    
- **Stabbing:** +1 damage on all special rolls; −1 damage on a successful attack roll of 5 or less.
    
- **Crushing:** Ignores 1 Armor; −1 damage against unarmored targets.
    
- **Reaching:** Provides an asset to Speed defense rolls against melee attacks, unless the attacker is also using a reaching weapon; attack rolls are hindered in tight spaces.
    
- **Firearm:** Ignores 1 Armor.
    

### EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 203)

Bombs, grenades, missiles, and other explosives operate differently than other weapons. They affect all targets within an area (usually an immediate area) and inflict damage to all of them. A separate attack roll is required for each (or a Speed defense roll if the PCs are the targets of such an attack), although to simplify, the player can make one attack roll and compare it to the difficulty to attack each target. Usually, even if the attack roll fails (or the Speed defense roll succeeds), the targets still suffer a smaller amount of damage, often 1 point.

Explosives like grenades can be thrown a short distance. Otherwise, another launcher weapon is needed to project them a long distance (or farther).

**Editor's Notes —** When making area attacks, consider the rules for attack modifiers and special situations and combat between PCs—specifics might determine that one use of an ability doesn't result in "friendly fire", but another does. This could also be a source of GM Intrusion.

## MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS AND SERVICES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 203)

Although the types of items for sale vary greatly based on the setting, a few things are always present, like food, lodging, and clothing. However, these goods and services can span the price categories. For example, you can get an inexpensive meal, a moderately priced meal, an expensive meal, and so on. An inexpensive meal is light and probably not very nutritious. An expensive meal is available only in nice restaurants in certain locations. An exorbitant meal is probably a feast for a crowd, with the finest foods and drink available.

Nightly lodging is similar, although the bottom end starts out worse. An inexpensive night's lodging is probably a flea-ridden mat on the floor of a room filled with other lodgers. Typical lodging (a private room with a decent bed) is probably in the moderately priced range. Very expensive lodging might be a suite of rooms with delicious meals and personal services (such as massages and grooming) included.

Inexpensive clothing is just a step up from rags, but moderately priced clothing is decent enough. For a formal party, you'd want expensive clothing. The very rich likely wear very expensive clothing most of the time, and exorbitant clothing (and jewelry) when they go to their elite galas.

Other sorts of miscellaneous items can be found in Part 3: Genres.

## CYPHERS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 204)

Cyphers can sometimes be physical items like equipment, but they work very differently. To be entirely accurate, cyphers might have the veneer of equipment, but don't fall into the trap of confusing the two. Cyphers are far more akin to PC special abilities than to gear. In a fantasy game, they might be potions, scrolls, or charms. In a science fiction game, cyphers might be interesting throwaway devices or alien crystals of unknown providence. In other games, they might just represent good fortune or sudden inspiration. See Chapter 24: : Cyphers for more details.

**Editor's Notes —** For more on cyphers, see Cyphers in Chapter 25: : Running the Cypher System.

## ARTIFACTS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 204)

Artifacts are more powerful than equipment and can't simply be purchased. Part 3: Genres offers a few sample artifacts appropriate for various settings.

Each artifact has a level and a rate of power depletion. When an artifact is used or activated, the player rolls the designated die (1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100). If the die shows the depletion number(s), the item works, but that is its last use. A depletion entry of "—" means that the artifact never depletes, and an entry of "automatic" means that it can be used only once.

Depowered artifacts can sometimes be recharged using the repair rules, depending on the item's nature. Other special abilities can also repower an expended item, but probably for only one use.

### FINDING, IDENTIFYING, AND USING ARTIFACTS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 204)

Characters can sometimes find artifacts while on adventures. They might be in ancient ruins, either intact or in need of manipulation to get them working. They could have been stolen from well-guarded military installations. They might be granted as rewards or taken from fallen foes. Sometimes they can even be purchased from a specialized source, but this occurs more rarely than most PCs would probably like.

After the characters find an artifact, identifying it is a separate Intellect task. The GM sets the difficulty of the task, but it is usually equal to the artifact's level. Identifying it takes fifteen minutes to three hours. If the PCs can't identify an artifact, they can bring it to an expert to be identified or, if desired, traded or sold.

Characters can attempt to use an artifact that has not been identified, which is usually an Intellect task equal to the artifact's level + 2. Failure might mean that the PCs can't figure out how to use the artifact or they use it incorrectly (GM's discretion). Of course, even if characters use an unidentified artifact correctly the first time, they have no idea what the effect might be.

Once characters identify an artifact, using it for the first time requires an additional Intellect action; this process is far more complex than pushing a button. It can involve manipulating touchscreens, reciting the proper arcane words, or anything else that fits the setting. The GM sets the difficulty, but it is usually equal to the artifact's level.
