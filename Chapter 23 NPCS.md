# Chapter 23: NPCS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 372)

The NPCs in this chapter are generic examples of nonplayer characters that can be used in many genres.

- **Reskinning NPCs:** GMs will find that with a few tweaks, a guard can be a modern-day cop, a fantasy caravan guard, or a science fiction drone soldier. This is known as reskinning—making slight changes to existing stats to customize the NPC for your own game.
    
- **Health, Not Pools:** Remember that NPCs don't have stat Pools. Instead, they have a characteristic called health. When an NPC takes damage of any kind, the amount is subtracted from its health. Unless described otherwise, an NPC's health is always equal to its target number. Some NPCs might have special reactions to or defenses against attacks that would normally deal Speed damage or Intellect damage, but unless the NPC's description specifically explains this, assume that all damage is subtracted from the NPC's health.
    
- **Appropriate Weapons:** NPCs use weapons appropriate to their situation, which might be swords and crossbows, knives and shotguns, malefic psychic weapons, blasters and grenades, and so on.
    

**Editor's Notes —** The contents of this chapter has been expanded to include creatures that have a humanoid body type, or that are frequently portrayed as having the capability for (or empathy with) human experience, and any creature with a proper name. In the end, these are all a distinction without a difference: NPCs are creatures, and creatures are NPCs.

For more on creatures and NPCs, including a full index, see Quick Reference: Creatures and NPCs.

Additionally, Monte Cook Games also provides an online [Cypher System Creature Index](https://www.montecookgames.com/cypher-system-creature-search/) that includes creatures from across their published material.

### ÁINE, FAIRY QUEEN OF LIGHT AND LOVE9 (27)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 124)

Áine is the fairy queen of summer and the sun, and is known by many names: the Fairy Queen of Light and Love, Bright One, Sun Goddess, and Sweetheart of the Fairies. She is a kind, true, and benevolent ruler, and is loved by nearly everyone. Known for making just and fair bargains with humans, she is often sought after for blessings and boons.

- **Motive:** To be just and true, to protect her realm
    
- **Environment:** She shares a fairy realm with her sister, Gráinne, where she rules in the summer months.
    
- **Health:** 99
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 12 points
    
- **Armor:** 5
    
- **Movement:** Short; very long when shapeshifted
    
- **Combat:** Áine rarely engages in combat herself, as she prefers to leave that role to her son Geroid and his army. However, if she's attacked or feels the need to defend her realm or someone in it, she will not hesitate to step in. She attacks using the power of the sun, focusing light into a narrow beam that inflicts 12 points of damage on the target.
    
    In addition, Áine has the power of chlorokineses—she can manipulate plants and flowers within very long range, causing them to grow to enormous proportions. She can use them as weapons that grab and hold multiple victims (level 7 Might task to break free) or that do damage via strangulation or thorns (7 points of damage). Any bees in the area act to help the queen.
    
    She can also shapeshift into a red mare as she chooses. As a mare, she inflicts 6 points of damage with her hooves or bite, can become immaterial as an action (makes it impossible to successfully attack her, but she cannot attack in this form), and can move to a spot within long range instantaneously (does not require an action).
    

**Queen's bees:** level 3; sting victims for 3 points of damage and paralyze them for one round

- **Interaction:** Just, true, and kind, Áine makes a powerful ally, provided that she does not feel that she or her realm are threatened. Those who wish harm on others or who she sees as malevolent in action or thought are more likely to find themselves on the wrong end of the Bright One's anger.
    
- **Use:** Characters who wish for something important in their lives to change may ask Áine to grant them a boon. She sometimes helps those in need without them asking for it (but, of course, only for a price). If the characters attend a fairy ball or feast, they may encounter Áine as an honored guest.
    
- **Loot:** Áine wears a crown of glass, but it is not visible unless she chooses it to be (she rarely does) or she dies. She carries little else, for she is a person of deeds, not items.
    

**GM Intrusion:** One of Áine's ardent followers believes a character is threatening their beloved queen.

### ARISTOCRAT4 (12)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 137)

Aristocrats are not quite high royalty—they are not kings or queens, nor even princes and princesses—but they are those with money and power enough to wield in dangerous or glorious ways. Knights and barons are typically aristocrats, as are characters like Bluebeard and Mr. Fox. Some aristocrats, such as knights, may only want to do good and protect the things that matter to them. Others, of course, prefer to use the darker side of their privileged position.

- **Motive:** Money, power, marriage, take who or what they want, protect what they care about
    
- **Environment:** Typically in cities and towns, occasionally off by themselves in large castles and manors
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Social engineering, persuasion, intimidation, and lying as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Many aristocrats have had training in combat maneuvers, as is appropriate to their station. Others may wield knives, scalpels, or butcher's tools with precision.
    
- **Interaction:** Interaction with an aristocrat often starts out positive—after all, it is delightful to be in the glow of someone so charming and powerful. For some, the interaction remains positive. A knight is just a knight. For others, a sense of unease begins to settle in after a time, as if there's something not quite right behind the facade.
    
- **Use:** An aristocrat is about to marry and someone is worried about the safety of their future spouse. A knight is outmatched by a dragon or other strong opponent and seeks someone to come to their aid.
    
- **Loot:** Most aristocrats have currency equal to a very expensive item, in addition to fine clothes or medium armor, weapons, and miscellaneous items.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The aristocrat's house has a sentient door or lock that suddenly begins to yell about intruders.

### ASSASSIN6 (18)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 373)

An assassin kills with poison, with high-velocity bullets from a distance, or by arranging for an unfortunate accident. Assassins accept contracts from governments, corporations, crime bosses, and aggrieved former partners, though some assassins pay themselves by tracking criminals anywhere to collect on "dead or alive" bounties.

- **Motive:** Murder (usually for hire)
    
- **Health:** 18
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth and deception tasks as level 8; when attacking from hiding, melee and ranged attacks as level 7
    
- **Combat:** An assortment of small weapons are hidden about an assassin's body. They can also coat their weapons or ammo with a level 6 poison that moves victims who fail a Might defense roll one step down the damage track.
    
- **Interaction:** Some assassins have a sort of integrity about their work and can't be dissuaded from completing their contracts with bribes.
    
- **Use:** An assassin is greatly feared by anyone with powerful, wealthy enemies.
    
- **Loot:** Aside from their weapons and poisons, most assassins have currency equivalent to a very expensive item and maybe one or two cyphers.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character loses their next turn, stunned, after recognizing the assassin to be the same murderer who killed someone important to them in the past.

### BARD3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 133)

A bard uses the power of words and music to create magic that inspires and influences others. A typical bard plays a musical instrument and weaves song-spells that rival the magic of wizards and priests, but some use their voices, creating fascinating tales and dramatic speeches.

- **Motive:** Entertainment, interaction, and novel experiences
    
- **Health:** 10
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Music, oration, persuasion, stealth, and Speed defense as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Bards prefer weapons that rely on speed and agility, like daggers, rapiers, and small bows. Every other round, a bard can create a blast of pure sound that inflicts 3 points of damage (ignores Armor) to one target within short range.
    
    A bard knows several spells, such as adding +1 to recovery rolls of nearby creatures, making an indifferent creature friendly (or a hostile one indifferent) for a few minutes, deafening one opponent for hours, easing a physical task by two steps, turning invisible for a minute, or negating sound for a minute.
    
- **Interaction:** Bards are personable and easy to talk to, but they have a sharp wit and a sharper tongue when it comes to critics and tyrants. A bard would rather escape from a dangerous situation than fight to the death.
    
- **Use:** A bard ally often has useful information about the current situation, drawn from songs and folk tales. In a pinch, they can make do as a scout or spy, especially in an urban setting. An unfriendly bard mocks the characters and turns the will of a crowd against them.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to a musical instrument and a nice outfit for performing, bards usually have currency equivalent to a moderately priced item and one or two cyphers.
    

### BERSERKER3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 134)

A berserker is a fierce warrior who can fly into a rage, greatly increasing their strength and hardiness. Many of them choose an animal such as a bear, wolf, or boar as their spiritual kin, wearing the skin of that animal and fighting like wild beasts.

- **Motive:** Glory in battle
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1 (or 3 when berserk)
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Climbing, jumping, running, and Speed defense as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Berserkers prefer large, heavy weapons such as axes, hammers, and greatswords, but they may use bows if they can't easily get close to their foes.
    
    A berserker can enter a state of rage as part of their action. When raging, they gain +1 to Armor (including against fire), their melee attacks inflict an additional 2 points of damage, and their attacks, Might defense, and actions relying on strength (such as climbing and jumping) are eased by two steps. However, their Speed defense is hindered. A raging berserker fights only with melee weapons and won't retreat from battle.
    
- **Interaction:** Berserkers are the elites of some warrior cultures and enjoy physical competitions such as wrestling, throwing heavy items, and feasting. They dislike weak and cowardly folk, and do not tolerate insults to their strength or honor.
    
- **Use:** A group of warriors is led by a mighty berserker looking for a challenging fight. A group of berserkers enters town and picks fights with the local toughs.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their weapons and light armor, a berserker has one or two moderately priced items. The leader of a group might have a cypher that enhances strength or toughness.
    

### BLACKGUARD6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 100)

Blackguards are evil knights who serve dark entities or their own corrupt agendas. Some were once honorable knights who fell to temptation and have abandoned their original principles, but many were raised under evil circumstances and have never known anything but hatred and conflict.

- **Motive:** Power, domination of others, slaughter
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere, either alone or as part of a cult or evil organization
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 2 or 3
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when mounted
    
- **Modifications:** Perception and Intellect defense as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Blackguards use high-quality armor and weapons (usually decorated with symbols depicting death, demons, or evil gods). Many wear heavy armor and prefer weapons that inflict bleeding wounds, but some take a more subtle approach and act more like assassins than knights. A blackguard typically has two or three of the following abilities:
    
    - _Fiendish Beast:_ The blackguard has a companion creature such as a dog, horse, or raven with an eerie, unnatural look (in the case of small animals, the creature may also be an exceptionally large specimen of its kind). The creature is actually a semi-intelligent fiend in animal shape (and therefore immune to abilities that affect only normal animals) that can understand the blackguard's commands, and may even be able to speak. If the beast is a horse or similar creature, the blackguard might ride it as a mount.
    - _Necromancy:_ The blackguard uses a ten-minute ritual to animate a human-sized corpse as a zombie under their control. The zombie becomes a corpse again after a day.
    - _Poison:_ The blackguard coats their weapons with a level 6 poison; a foe who fails a Might defense roll moves one step down the damage track.
    - _Spells:_ The blackguard knows several spells granted by an evil entity, typically spells that cause a foe to flee in fear for one minute, restore 10 health, create an eerie darkness or fog in long range, or grant +5 Armor against energy and magical attacks for an hour.
    - _Surprise Attack:_ When the blackguard attacks from a hidden vantage, with surprise, or before their opponent has acted in combat, they get an asset on the attack and inflict +4 points of damage. Unholy
    - _Aura:_ Defense rolls by foes within immediate distance of the blackguard are hindered.
    - _Unholy Blessing:_ The blackguard's defense rolls are eased.

**Fiendish beast:** level 4, stealth as level 5, Might and Intellect defense as level 5

- **Interaction:** Blackguards enjoy killing righteous paragons of good and are often cruel for the sake of cruelty itself.
    
- **Use:** A blackguard has united various groups of bandits into a small army. An evil wizard sends her blackguard lieutenant to kill the people interfering with her plans.
    
- **Loot:** Blackguards usually have treasures equivalent to three or four expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact weapon or armor.
    

**GM Intrusions:** The blackguard's weapon flares with unholy power, inflicting an additional 6 points of damage (ignores Armor). A slain blackguard rises as an undead or is possessed by a demon and continues to fight.

### CAILLEACH5 (15)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 129)

Not actually a water spirit, but one who has made her peace with the sea in an eternal bargain, Cailleach once lived on land. Now she is a recluse deep in the ocean in the realm known as the Expanse of Halirane. She appears ancient, and in fact is much older than that. She shaves her head bald, wears dozens of shell earrings in each ear, and has a glass eye that allows her to see three views of the future. As part of her bargain with the sea, she can never return to dry land again, or she will lose all of her powers forever.

- **Motive:** To be left alone
    
- **Environment:** A home hidden inside a coral reef at the bottom of the ocean. Her home is a large dead whale that the sea magically preserves as part of their bargain.
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Movement:** Short; very long when shapeshifted
    
- **Modifications:** Seeing through deceptions and lies as level 6, healing as level 8
    
- **Combat:** Cailleach has many abilities at her disposal, some of which come from the sea and others that come from her own magic. They include the following:
    
    - _Healing Pot:_ If she has the proper ingredients and takes a day to do so, Cailleach can brew a healing salve in her special pot. Depending on what she adds to the mixture, this salve can do one of three things: restore 10 Might points, move someone up one step on the damage track, or remove a curse (up to level 6).
    - _Reptilian Form:_ Cailleach takes the form of a reptile of any size. While in this form, she has +3 Armor and does 6 points of damage with her bite, claw, or tail lash. In addition, she regains 3 points of health per round.
    - _Restore to Life:_ Putting her wizened pointer finger into someone's mouth can bring them back to life, but only if they've been dead for less than a day and only if she holds her finger there for exactly as long as they've been dead. After that, her finger falls off. It takes three days for her to regrow a new one.
    - _See the Future:_ Cailleach can use her glass eye to scry the future of an individual. She does so by first removing the eye, and then having the person hold it in their mouth until she asks for it back (sometimes this is for just a second, and sometimes it's for hours—it's hard to know if the variable length of time is part of the ritual or just her dark sense of humor). She typically sees three possible futures, and all of them have an equal chance of coming to pass.
    - _Wanton Destruction:_ As part of her agreement with the sea, Cailleach was given the power to control small parts of it at a time. She can create a whirlpool that catches up all creatures and objects within short range of its center and inflicts 5 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).
- **Interaction:** Cailleach is a recluse and introvert whose deepest longing is to be left alone to increase her knowledge of magic. She also likes puzzles and games, and out of everything on land, she misses birds most of all (for interacting with, not eating). Those who bring her any of those items are likely to draw Cailleach out of her shell and have a positive interaction.
    
- **Use:** Cailleach can be a beneficial ally, particularly as a healer. She might also be convinced to help fight against an encroaching danger, especially if it's threatening her solitude and privacy.
    
- **Loot:** She typically carries a number of sea cyphers, and her home is filled with books, scrolls, and journals of all sorts.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The sea offers additional assistance to Cailleach's spells, increasing her damage or movement.

### CANNIBAL3 (9)

(STAY ALIVE, PAGE 118)

A cannibal is someone who has decided that eating other people is not only necessary but desirable. Whether this decision was forced by circumstance or made out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are dangerous because they hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and aid for strangers until their prey lowers their guard. That's when a cannibal strikes. Some cannibals like it raw; others delight in elaborate preparations.

- **Motive:** Hungers for human flesh
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and tasks related to friendly interaction as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Cannibals use whatever weapon is at hand. They usually don't attack unless they can surprise their prey. When cannibals have surprise, they attack as level 5 creatures and inflict 2 additional points of damage.
    
- **Interaction:** Cannibals seem friendly and charming until they decide you are for dinner.
    
- **Use:** Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or stay for the night are invited in by one or more cannibals—perhaps an entire family of them.
    
- **Loot:** A cannibal has currency equivalent to a very expensive item and possibly a cypher.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The cannibal reveals a severed and gnawed- upon body part of a previous victim. The character must succeed on an Intellect defense task or be stunned and lose their next turn.

#### CANNIBAL, POST-APOCALYPTIC3 (9)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 98)

Cannibals come in a variety of different forms, depending on their situation. Some seem like normal and perhaps even charming survivors, except to their targets. These "nice" cannibals may eat human flesh when desperate or to take advantage of meat that would otherwise go to waste. Or maybe they've developed a taste for human flesh.

Others look the part, having descended into the kind of bestial, erratic behavior that cannibalism can inflict on long term practitioners.

Some are part of a crazed settlement of raiders always looking for more sweet meats, and others hide in plain sight, pretending friendship and offering aid to strangers until their prey lowers their guard. Some cannibals like their prey raw; others delight in elaborate preparations.

Whether becoming an eater of human flesh was forced by circumstance or out of some secret, maladaptive urge, cannibals are dangerous.

- **Motive:** Hunger for human flesh
    
- **Environment:** In areas where food is scarce; alone, or in groups of four to ten
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and friendly interaction as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Cannibals use improvised weapons, like ropes, chair legs, and jagged pieces of broken glass. A few cannibals with more resources rely on long range firearms and rifles until they run out of ammunition.
    
    In any group of four or more cannibals, there's probably one (revealed as a GM intrusion) who has filed their teeth and can make a horrific bite attack once every minute or two. This attack inflicts damage and requires the target to succeed on a Might defense roll. On a failure, the cannibal bites off a bit of the target, who is stunned and loses their next turn. See the Cannibal Severing Bite Effects table.
    

Cannibal Severing Bite Effects

|d6|Effects|
|---|---|
|1|End of nose|
|2|Little finger|
|3|Chunk from forearm|
|4|Chunk from leg|
|5|Ear; target's perception task that rely on hearing are hindered until target adapts|
|6|Throat; target descends on step on damage track each round until ally succeeds on a difficulty 5 healing task|

- **Interaction:** A friendly and charming cannibal may remain so indefinitely, unless they decide a PC is perfect for dinner.
    
- **Use:** Characters looking for a place to sleep, hide, or stay for the night are invited in by one or more cannibals. A group of raiders the PCs must negotiate with are also revealed to be cannibals.
    
- **Loot:** A cannibal has currency equivalent to an expensive item.
    

### CHILD1 (3)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 138)

Children play the roles of urchins, siblings, daughters, sons, waifs, servants, royal family members, child brides, and more.

- **Motive:** Seeking safety, comfort, money, or food; play; bringing joy
    
- **Environment:** With their families, or lost in the world trying to find their way. Sometimes in the employ or care of someone who has found them, stolen them, or otherwise become their guardians, caretakers, or keepers.
    
- **Health:** 3
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 1 point
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Run, hide, sneak, and escape as level 2; knowledge of the nearby area, people, and activities as level 3
    
- **Combat:** Most children fight only in response to being provoked, threatened, or attacked. They typically use makeshift weapons, such as their fists, a stick, or a toy.
    
- **Interaction:** Children are often smarter, more creative, and more wily than they're given credit for. They may have a lot of knowledge about nearby people, places, and activities that can help the PCs, particularly if there's an exchange of food, money, or other goodies involved.
    
- **Use:** Someone or something is stealing children from the village, and the mayor is offering to pay a large sum to anyone who tracks down the creature and rescues the children. One of the PCs catches a waif stealing from their pack in the night; the child says they've been lost in the woods for days.
    
- **Loot:** Children typically have very little on their person, although they may have a special memento of their family or a close friend.
    

**GM Intrusions:** The child shouts, laughs, or talks too loudly, accidentally drawing the attention of a nearby guard toward a character.

Someone mistakenly thinks a character has stolen the child, and attacks them.

### CAMBION5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 101)

Fine ebony scales cover a cambion's perfectly athletic figure. Two reddish horns grow from its brow, and the tips of fangs emerge from between its dusky lips. Its eyes, absent iris and pupil, are the color of driven snow. Cambions are cursed creatures, born of mortal and demonic parentage, and are also sometimes called helborn. Most cambions give in to what everyone expects of them, and embrace evil.

- **Motive:** Defense, conquest, revenge on a world that's rejected them
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere, often hiding in plain sight
    
- **Health:** 25
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Disguise as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Cambions sometimes wield heavy weapons in combat, especially if they come across an artifact that can enhance their attacks. Some cambions develop their natural and magical abilities to become powerful sorcerers, but most can call up hellish energy merely by willing it at least once per day, as follows.
    
    - _Finger of Torture:_ A ruby ray lances out from the cambion's finger to strike an enemy prone with torturous pain on a failed Might defense task. The target automatically takes 6 points of damage each round until they can escape the effect with an Intellect task.
    - _Soulfire Blast:_ An explosion of soul-rending black and crimson fire explodes around up to three targets standing next to each other within short range, inflicting 4 points of damage and stunning the targets so that they lose their next action on a failed Speed defense task.
- **Interaction:** Cambions are bleak, depressed, and misunderstood. Most have turned to evil, but a few can be redeemed.
    
- **Use:** A great fire is seen burning on the horizon. The next day, travelers come across a burned region with a crater that has destroyed a farmhouse. At the center of the crater is an unconscious human with hornlike growths on its head.
    
- **Loot:** Powerful cambions sometimes wield artifacts as weapons.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character's cypher explodes when touched by cambion demon fire on a failed Speed defense task.

### CORRUPT MAGE7 (21)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 102)

Some wizards and sorcerers are tempted by dark magic, inevitably damning their souls and corrupting their flesh as they cut corners and delve into forbidden lore. Their research and experimentation create new kinds of rampaging monsters and turn people into misshapen horrors. They sometimes modify their own bodies in order to gain demonic or draconic powers, or make pacts with such creatures for knowledge and magical ingredients.

- **Motive:** Magical knowledge at all costs
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere, usually with fleshbeast minions
    

Fleshbeast

 

level 4; attacks as level 5; health 15; Armor 1

- **Health:** 35
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** All tasks related to knowledge of arcane lore, demons, and altering bodies as level 8
    
- **Combat:** Corrupt mages blast opponents with beams of energy that blister, slash, and rot flesh, attacking up to three creatures as an action. Many of them have given themselves long claws and teeth that they can use to make up to three melee attacks per action.
    
    A corrupt mage knows many spells, such as the following:
    
    - _Armor:_ Covers a creature with ugly scales, granting them +3 to Armor for an hour.
    - _Madness:_ Wracks the brain of one creature within short range for one hour, reducing them to a babbling catatonic state in which they can't recognize friend or foe. If disturbed or harmed, the creature is likely to lash out with lethal force at what it perceives as its tormentors.
    - _Organ Request:_ Extracts a handful of internal organs from an opponent within short range, moving the creature one step down the damage track if it fails a Might defense roll.
    - _Polymorph:_ Transforms one foe within short range into a tiny, helpless creature such as a cockroach, fish, or snail for one hour.
    - _Summon Demon:_ Summons a demon to serve the mage for one hour.
    - _Teleport:_ Moves the mage up to 100 miles (160 km) away, or less far if they bring additional creatures with them.
    - _Twist Flesh:_ Reshapes the flesh of a creature within close range, turning it into a hideous monstrosity for one hour. The transformed creature's actions are hindered, but its physical attacks inflict +3 points of damage. The mage's control over the creature is limited to indicating which target it should attack.
    
    A corrupt mage usually has several cyphers useful in combat and perhaps an artifact as well.
    
- **Interaction:** Corrupt mages generally can't be trusted and see other creatures as things to experiment on and vivisect. They might negotiate with someone who brings them a rare specimen or spell. Many are mentally disturbed by their research and self-alterations and may fluctuate between calm clarity, obsession, paranoia, and rage.
    
- **Use:** The strange hybrid monsters emerging from the forest are said to be the creations of a corrupt mage. A corrupt mage in a calm state presents themselves as a neutral or benevolent wizard seeking assistance on a task.
    
- **Loot:** A corrupt mage has 1d6 cyphers and perhaps a wizardly artifact.
    

**GM Intrusions:** A desperate or dying corrupt mage transforms their own body into several new fleshbeasts, which retain fragments of the mage's intelligence and immediately attack. The mage's attack spell is incredibly painful, stunning the character for one round if they fail a Might defense roll.

### CRAFTER2 (6)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 138)

Crafters include bakers, cobblers, candlemakers, butchers, millers, tailors, woodworkers, and cooks. While most crafters aren't particularly agile fighters, they are usually clever and strong, and have a number of familiar tools at their disposal for weapons.

- **Motive:** Defense
    
- **Environment:** In their workshops or peddling their trade while traveling
    
- **Health:** 8
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Appropriate craft as level 3
    
- **Combat:** Crafters are unlikely to initiate combat, as most just want to be left alone to do their work (or to convince you to buy their wares). If they're forced to fight, they will typically use any item they have at hand (such as a rolling pin, butcher's knife, crafting tool, or length of wood).
    
- **Interaction:** Most crafters are happy to talk about their craft or the objects that they've made and have for sale. They take pride in their work, and flattery and attention can go a long way.
    
- **Use:** To the PCs, crafters can be allies, obstacles, or both. Being friends with a crafter often has obvious long-term benefits, while stealing from them has short-term advantages (and possible long-term disadvantages).
    
- **Loot:** A crafter has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, as well as crafting tools and materials and anything they've crafted that they're carrying or wearing.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The crafter uses their crafting tool in a way that the character didn't anticipate, putting the character in a disadvantaged position.

### CRIME BOSS3 (9)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 373)

A crime boss usually isn't physically powerful but wields power through lies, bribery, and control. Rarely encountered alone, they rely on guards, thugs, and other measures to provide physical security. A crime boss could be a petty noble, a mafia king, or the captain of a pirate ship that sails the seas or glides the space lanes.

- **Motive:** Money and power
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Deception, persuasion, intimidation, and tasks related to friendly interaction as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Guards, thugs, and other followers deal 1 additional point of damage when the crime boss can see them and issue commands. If possible, crime bosses fight while mounted or in a vehicle, directing their followers from the rear of any conflict, concentrating first on issuing orders.
    
- **Interaction:** Crime bosses are committed to their plans, whatever those might be. Most bosses rely on a lieutenant or trusted thug to interact with people in their place.
    
- **Use:** A crime boss and their followers execute a heist on a secure location and take hostages when things go south. Someone must go in and talk to the crime boss to defuse the situation.
    
- **Loot:** A crime boss has currency equivalent to a very expensive item in addition to weapons, medium armor, and miscellaneous gear.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The crime boss uses a clever trick or cypher to block all incoming attacks in a given round of combat.

### DEATH10 (∞)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 114)

Death goes by many names, takes many forms, and has only one purpose: to make all equal in the end. Death is often an unwanted visitor—taking the life of someone who is not ready to go—but just as often, they come to those who are ready. To them, Death is a most welcome, the most welcome, guest of all.

While some see Death as evil, they are not inherently so, no more than the cougar hunting the hare for dinner. In fact, they are the great equalizer, raising paupers to kings and kings to common people.

Death is ancient, but not old. Wise, but not all-knowing. Brilliant, but not perfect. Death is also, very often, bored. They have seen everything, heard everything, and done everything that it is possible for an immortal being to do, and some days they feel sure they will never experience anything new or interesting again. But still, they try, taking on new guises, hiding themselves away, even traveling to distant stars and moons before their duties and obligations once again pull them to return.

If Death appears at the foot of a person's bed, that person can recover if the proper steps are taken. If Death is at the head of the bed, almost nothing can be done to save the victim, beyond an impossible bargain.

- **Motive:** To do their duty and make everyone equal
    
- **Environment:** Everywhere and anywhere
    
- **Health:** ∞
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** Death
    
- **Armor:** Immune to all harm
    
- **Movement:** Variable depending on their form, but Death can move instantaneously almost anywhere that they desire
    
- **Modifications:** Seeing through trickery, deception, or bargaining as level 8
    
- **Combat:** Death kills. They kill any number of ways, depending on their mood, what's at hand, and how they believe the person should leave their life. Thankfully, death only comes for someone when their time is up.
    
    Still, it's not considered wise to provoke or challenge Death to physical combat, for there is only one outcome: a single attack from Death kills the victim (except in the rare case where the victim has protection against death, such as with one of Death's candles).
    
- **Interaction:** Death cannot be hurt and cannot be killed, but they can be bargained with, bet against, and sometimes tricked. More rarely, they have even been known to lose a bargain or be captured for a short period of time.
    
- **Use:** Bargaining with Death is a potential way to achieve an impossible task or gain a very rare item, but of course it always comes with a price (usually an earlier death for the bargainer or someone else). Death is always looking for something interesting going on, and may appear just to spend time with the characters if they're engaged in an intriguing activity.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Death mistakes a character for someone else.

### DETECTIVE3 (9)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 374)

Detectives are usually veterans of their organization (such as the police, city watch, marshals, space command, and so on) with extensive experience. Some detectives are freelance sleuths whose uncanny ability to see the truth comes from personal training combined with an underlying talent for noticing clues that others miss.

- **Motive:** Solve the crime
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks relating to perception, intuition, initiative, and detecting falsehoods as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Detectives prefer to outwit their foes rather than engage in a straight-up fight. Even then, most conflicts occur in a place and time of the detective's choosing, preferably in the presence of their allies. A detective can deduce weaknesses of their enemies (if any) and exploit them in combat.
    
- **Interaction:** Some detectives are insufferable know-it-alls. Others have learned that humility is also a useful tool for getting answers from people.
    
- **Use:** To the PCs, detectives can be obstacles (a detective is on their trail), allies (a detective helps them assemble clues), or both, but the sleuths are rarely a way for the characters to hand off responsibility for accomplishing a hard task.
    
- **Loot:** Aside from their weapons, most detectives have currency equivalent to a very expensive item and a cypher.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The detective intuits the character's next attack and moves perfectly so that an ally of the character takes the attack instead.

### DRUID4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 134)

A druid is a servant of a nature deity or the entirety of nature itself. Some have specific interests such as animals, plants, or storms, with greater powers relating to that devotion. Druids are leaders and advisors in some cultures, society-hating hermits in others.

- **Motive:** Protecting nature
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Nature lore, perception, and stealth as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Druids use simple weapons crafted out of natural materials, such as spears, slings, and bows, as well as ritual tools such as daggers and sickles.
    
    A druid knows several spells, such as a short-range attack that uses electricity or fire, healing a touched creature for 4 health, calming and befriending animals, traveling quickly, controlling the weather within long range, transforming into an animal or plant, and manipulating the natural elements. A druid often has a loyal animal companion, such as a black bear, hawk, viper, or wolf.
    
- **Interaction:** Druids are cautious when dealing with city folk, and they act quickly to stop the reckless use of fire or exploitation of the wilds. They are generally on good terms with local animals and magical creatures of nature (faeries, sapient trees, satyrs, and so on).
    
- **Use:** A hermit druid comes to the aid of injured or lost characters in the wildlands. A druid has been attacking loggers and hunters who stray too far from civilization.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to weapons, light armor, and some moderately priced ritual items, a druid might have a couple of cyphers or perhaps an artifact.
    

### DWARF4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 135)

A typical dwarf found outside of their homeland is an explorer, warrior, and tradesperson of some skill. Dwarves travel to find work as mercenaries, sell the goods they create, or find unusual materials to use in their crafting.

- **Motive:** Defense, loyalty, honor
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Crafting (metal or stone), Intellect defense, and Might defense as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Dwarves traditionally use weapons like axes, hammers, and crossbows. They're used to working together to defend their halls; three or more dwarves attacking the same target act as a level 6 creature that inflicts 8 points of damage.
    
    Dwarf leaders are usually officers or priests.
    

Dwarf officer

 

level 5; health 16; damage inflicted 7 points

Dwarf priest

 

level 5; health 16; can heal one creature for 10 points or all within immediate range for 5 points

- **Interaction:** Dwarves are proud and hardworking, but they tend to be stubborn, gruff, and unforgiving of offenses to them or their clan. It takes time to gain their trust, but they respect a fair deal, a hard bargain, a sharp axe, and a sturdy hammer.
    
- **Use:** A stoic old dwarf is looking to go on one more quest before retiring. A clan of dwarves seeks a trade agreement with a human city leader—or redress for an old insult.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their weapons and light or medium armor, a dwarf probably has several moderately priced items (such as tools or exploration gear) and perhaps a cypher or two.
    

### ELF4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 135)

An elf has a very long lifespan and tends to learn and abandon many skills and interests, including combat and magic. Elves are likely to wander in pursuit of something new and interesting, such as finding the tallest tree in the forest, the most beautiful sunset, or the perfect love song.

- **Motive:** Curiosity
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Perception, Speed defense, and any two noncombat skills as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Elves usually fight with short or medium blades and delicate but deadly bows. Because of their subtle skill and fast reactions, their first attack in any combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage.
    
    A typical elf might know a few minor spells, such as heating or chilling food, creating a bit of moonlight, and cleaning or repairing clothing.
    
- **Interaction:** Elves appreciate beauty, grace, and skill, and they don't respond well to crudeness or bluster, especially from people decades or centuries younger than themselves. They are subtle in their insults but do have a sense of humor.
    
- **Use:** A group of young elves arrives in a city, wanting to see firsthand how the short-lived humans do things. An elf is said to have lived in the forest for a thousand years, listening to the secrets whispered by the trees.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their weapons and light armor, an elf carries a few moderately priced (but extremely well-made) curios and mementos, and usually a cypher.
    

**Editor's Notes —** See also: Shadow Elf.

### ENCHANTER5 (15)+

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 118)

Enchanters include magic-users of all genders. They may choose to call themselves wizards, sorcerers, mages, or diviners, depending on their strengths, abilities, and desired reputations.

Enchanters usually take great pride in their appearance, including their outfits, accouterments, and equipment. They often incorporate living or dead elements of dangerous creatures, such as spiders, snakes, crocodiles, and dragons, into the objects that matter to them. Additionally, they may imbue objects with powerful magic.

Enchanters can use long-lasting or even permanent versions of their magical abilities, but doing so usually requires minutes or hours of time.

Most enchanters have one or more apprentices or helpers, typically animals that have been made human temporarily or humans who are in the service of the enchanter until some debt of theirs or their family's has been paid.

Sorcerer's Apprentice

 

level 3

- **Motive:** Control magic, power
    
- **Environment:** Everywhere, particularly in places where magic is present and powerful
    
- **Health:** 20
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Using and controlling magic as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Magical weapons and artifacts (such as a whip made of living snakes, a staff with a biting wolf's head on top, or a sword that acts of its own accord) do 5 points of damage. Additionally, an enchanter may employ a number of magical abilities, including the following:
    
    - _Animate:_ Takes any material (such as wood or stone) and turns it into an animate level 4 creature. The creature has a mind and will of its own, and acts just as that type of creature would act if it were born instead of created.
    - _Blood to Stone:_ Turns living creatures into stone, or immobilizes them in their current form. Breaking free is a level 6 Might task.
    - _Enchant:_ Imbues a normal object with a magical power. The object works under the enchanter's command, and does as the enchanter asks of it. For example, an enchanter might imbue a foe's weapon and force it to attack the foe, or they might imbue a door and have it close tight against incoming dangers.
    - _Endless Passage:_ Creates an endless series of thick spiderwebs, invisible barriers, rings of flame, or other hurdles across an entrance, exit, tunnel, or passage. Every time one of the hurdles is broken, another forms. Characters' movement is halved while going through the endless passage, and they take 2 points of Intellect damage each round.
    - _Invisible:_ Turns anything (including themselves, others, and entire areas up to 30 feet by 30 feet [9 m by 9 m]) invisible for ten minutes. It's a level 6 Intellect task to be able to see something that has been made invisible.
    - _Persuasion:_ Convinces all victims in long range that what they believe is not real or that what is false is real. Sometimes this ability just affects others' minds, creating a mental dissonance. Other times, the enchanter creates an illusion or other visible, auditory, and tactile element that persuades a character to believe everything they are experiencing. The effect lasts for ten minutes. Additionally, an enchanter may have one or more of the same abilities as a witch or a faerie.
- **Interaction:** For the characters, an enchanter may be a terrifying foe or a powerful ally. Enchanters are fickle, perhaps due to their close relationship with magic, and may change their loyalties on a whim or an imagined slight.
    
- **Use:** The characters need to have an object imbued, a person returned to life, or a curse undone, and they turn to the enchanter for help. The characters accidentally insulted the enchanter in some way, and now the enchanter is hunting them down to get revenge.
    
- **Loot:** Enchanters often protect their precious items with spells and magical locks (level 8). Behind those wards are 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and an elegant or interesting outfit.
    

#### ENCHANTERS BY LEVEL

- 5Oz, the Great and Terrible (WAAMH, 120)
- 7Virgilius the Sorcerer (WAAMH, 120)
- 9Morgan Le Fay (WAAMH, 120)

#### MORGAN LE FAY9 (27)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 120)

Morgan le Fay (also known as Morgen, Margain, Morgant, and various other names) is a powerful sorceress from the legends of King Arthur. She has an unpredictable duality to her nature, with the potential for great good and great evil.

- **Combat:** Attacks with a variety of weapons, including a sword and staff. She also can use any of the following abilities: _charm_, _enchant_, _glamour_, _heal_, _invisible_, _persuasion_, _protect_, _revive_, _seduce_, and _shrivel_.
    
- **Interaction:** Morgan le Fay is fickle and enigmatic, and rarely reveals her purposes. If she agrees to help the characters in some way, it's absolutely because she has a higher goal in mind.
    
- **Use:** The characters are stopped by a beautiful woman in the woods, who asks them to help her accomplish a great task. A powerful foe has brought Morgan le Fay into his confidence, and she is helping him against the PCs.
    

#### OZ, THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE5 (15)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 120)

It is perhaps the greatest feat the Wizard of Oz ever pulled off to make everyone believe that he was not a sorcerer at all, but merely a ventriloquist and balloonist from some faraway land. He is, in fact, far more powerful than that, but prefers that no one were ever to know. For if they did, they would expect things of him, and that makes him anxious.

- **Combat:** Oz does not fight, but instead sends his army of green-whiskered soldiers forth.
    
    He may also use an artifact or spell to protect himself, hide himself, or flee. He can use the following abilities: _enchant_, _invisible_, _persuasion_.
    
- **Interaction:** Curmudgeonly and a bit of a humbug, but rarely with evil intent, Oz is likely to help those who ask, although he often fumbles things just to make a point.
    
- **Use:** The characters set off to meet the powerful ruler of a strange land. Or they encounter someone they believe is just a humble, simple man, but who instead turns out to be incredibly powerful.
    
- **Loot:** Oz has at least one artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers.
    

Green-whiskered soldiers

 

level 4; Armor 2; unloaded rifles deal 4 points of damage

#### VIRGILIUS THE SORCERER7 (21)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 120)

The most renowned of all the poet-sorcerers, Virgilius studies and uses the power of the written word to enhance his magical abilities. He keeps a black book, which is the source of his spells, and creates copper creatures to protect and defend him. He has a love of challenges, such as magician's battles, and seeks them out.

- **Combat:** Can use the following abilities: _animate_, _blood to stone_, _enchant_, _endless passage_.
    
- **Interaction:** Virgilius is quick thinking, wily, and full of interesting schemes. Those who entertain him for longer than a moment might find him a very useful ally. However, he is also driven toward revenge, particularly on those who attempt to publicly humiliate or shame him.
    
- **Use:** The characters enter into a battle of wits or wills, only to discover they're competing with Virgilius.
    
- **Loot:** Carries a black book
    

Black book (artifact)

 

level 6; allows the user to cast animate, blood to stone, enchant, or endless passage. Casting a spell from the black book costs 2 Intellect points and is an action. Depletion: 1 in 1d6

### EVIL PRIEST7 (21)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 108)

Evil priests are worshippers of evil gods, demons, devils, strange malevolent forces from beyond known dimensions, or even death itself. They lead cults, corrupt the innocent with lies and twisted ideologies, and enact the will of their patron in the mortal world. The most insidious ones are able to infiltrate good churches and secular organizations in order to tear them down from the inside.

- **Motive:** Domination of others, divine rule
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere that people live
    
- **Health:** 28
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Deception, persuasion, and religious lore as level 8
    
- **Combat:** Evil priests make one or two short-range magical attacks as an action, which are thematically appropriate to the god or entity they serve, such as blasts of hellfire, grasping shadowy tentacles, or disruptive necromantic energy. They often rely on zealous minions to protect them from melee opponents.
    
    Priests usually know several spells, such as how to banish or control creatures from other dimensions, create an area of darkness, see and hear remote locations, speak with the dead, mesmerize or paralyze a person, cause blindness, or create a ward against energy damage. They also have the following magical abilities:
    
    - _Curse:_ The priest curses a foe within short range, hindering all of the foe's actions by two steps.
    - _Heal:_ The priest heals a touched creature for 10 health or removes an affliction such as a disease or curse.
    - _Necromancy:_ The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to animate up to four human-sized corpses as skeletons or zombies under their control. The undead revert to corpses after a day.
    - _Sacrifice:_ The priest uses a ten-minute ritual to kill a helpless, restrained, or unconscious creature of level 4 or higher, using its soul to grant one ally an asset on all actions and defenses for one day.
    - _Summon:_ Once per hour the priest can summon a demon or one level 3 or 4 creature (such as a giant snake, giant spider, or swarm of bugs). The summoned creature serves the priest for an hour before vanishing.
    - _Swarm of bugs:_ level 3
    
    An evil priest usually has one or two combat-useful manifest cyphers and often has an artifact appropriate to their religion. Most also wear armor or have an ongoing defensive spell that grants them Armor.
    
- **Interaction:** Evil priests tend to be knowledgeable, arrogant, and condescending toward heroes and members of rival faiths. They might strike a bargain to save their lives or the life of a valuable minion, or to gain an advantage later on.
    
- **Use:** An evil priest is converting frightened peasants into followers, and turning those who refuse into zombie slaves. A new religious figure in the city is acting suspiciously, and members of rival faiths have been disappearing or turning up dead.
    
- **Loot:** Evil priests usually have mundane treasures equivalent to three or four expensive items, a few useful manifest cyphers, and an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusions:** The dying evil priest utters a curse that attempts to pull the character's soul into the afterlife with them, moving them one stepdown the damage track if they fail an Intellect defense roll.

The evil priest ignores, avoids, or immediately recovers from an attack that would have killed or greatly harmed them.

### FAIRY GODMOTHER6 (18)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 123)

Fairy godmothers are nearly always beneficent beings, typically acting as mentors, parents, or protectors, much like human godparents. The difference, of course, is that fairy godmothers have a great deal more magic at their disposal.

Overall, fairy godmothers are kind, gentle, and loving to almost everyone, not just their godchildren. Of course, not all fairy godmothers are good at their roles—some may act out of their own interests and inadvertently (or purposefully) do harm to those they are supposed to protect. This is particularly true if they feel like they have not been given the respect they deserve, or have been offended in some way.

And if you should harm someone they have pledged to protect? Beware, beware, for there is no wrath like that of a fairy godmother's.

- **Motive:** Protect their protégés, be respected
    
- **Environment:** Cities, towns, and anywhere someone is in need of assistance
    
- **Health:** 24
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 2 (magical)
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when flying
    
- **Combat:** Fairy godmothers attack by shooting a stream of sharp-edged glitter up to a long distance from their magic wands (glitter gets into every nook and cranny, and thus ignores Armor). Fairy godmothers can bestow blessings upon their friends and allies, and curse their enemies.
    
    Fairy godmothers can cast any of the skills and abilities that faeries can cast, as well as a few that are specific to them, including the following:
    
    - _A Little Luck:_ The fairy godmother blesses a character with luck, granting them the opportunity to reroll once in the next day without spending XP.
    - _A Little Misfortune:_ Despite the name, this is usually a beneficial spell. It is designed to give a nearby character something to overcome so that they might grow stronger in temperament or stature. When this spell is cast, the character receives a GM intrusion on their next action (no matter what their roll is) and receives 1 XP to give away (but not one to keep).
    - _Alteration:_ Can turn any creature within short range into a different creature (such as a mouse into a horse) and any object into a similarly shaped object (such as a pumpkin into a carriage, or a smock into a ball gown). The effect lasts for one day.
    - _Prophecy:_ Creates a prediction for the future of a single person. The prediction has a high chance of coming true, but is not certain. (Prophecies work like GM intrusions that will take place in the future; the player can reject the prophecy by spending an XP.) Not all prophecies are negative.
- **Interaction:** Interacting with fairy godmothers is usually a little frantic, frenzied, and full of "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" If they like you, they're likely to prove a loyal, steadfast, and useful ally. If not, well, hopefully you like being turned into a horse, or worse.
    
- **Use:** Fairy godmothers make great lighthearted additions to encounters, particularly ones where the characters are preparing for a ball, a fight, or a big adventure.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The fairy godmother's magic goes awry and a character is accidentally turned into a horse.

### GRÁINNE, THE WAYWARD DAUGHTER9 (27)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 125)

Gráinne is the Fairy Queen of Hope and Despair, sometimes also called the Wayward Daughter, the Winter Queen, and Dark One. Gráinne is to the dark what Áine is to the light. This doesn't mean that Gráinne is evil, just that she represents what is good and bad in the world that is hidden in shadows, buried beneath the ground, and revealed at night. She has her own moral code, one that can work in the favor of those who are cunning and willing to look at the darkness of their own hearts.

- **Motive:** To honor the darkness, to protect her realm
    
- **Environment:** She shares a fairy realm with her sister, where she rules in winter. In the summer, she sleeps in the Sorrows, a belowground realm out of time and space.
    
- **Health:** 99
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 12 points
    
- **Armor:** 5
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when flying
    
- **Combat:** Gráinne is a talented combatant, and seems to revel in having a foe who is a challenge to her. She carries a dark green crystal staff that emits a dark coil of reddish energy, which inflicts 12 points of damage. Alternatively, she can send out a cloud of black smoke that deals 9 points of damage to all creatures in a short area. She also wears the Tiara of Pailis, a griffin-shaped tiara that allows her to fly. Gráinne has a variety of magical abilities at her disposal, including the following:
    
    - _Animal Communication:_ Gráinne has a special affinity with badgers and can ask them for help. When she calls them (as an action), a cete of eight large badgers appears. They act as two level 4 creatures; attacked beings must also succeed on an Intellect defense roll or be shapeshifted into a badger for one round.
    - _Oneirokinesis:_ Gráinne can infiltrate people's dreams to converse with them. As such, she might implant an idea in their heads (such as "I'm going to die tonight" or "I should go back home"). When the character wakes, they must succeed on a level 6 Intellect defense roll to shake the idea. Otherwise, they feel a strong need to act on it, and are hindered in any tasks that go against the idea (this lasts until they make their next recovery roll).
    - _Shadowmelding:_ Gráinne merges with shadows, making her nearly intangible. In this form, she cannot be injured by physical attacks, and her attacks inflict 8 points of Intellect damage on anyone whose body is darkened by her shadow.
- **Interaction:** For those who don't mind a little darkness and moral ambiguity, Gráinne makes a powerful ally.
    
- **Use:** The characters stumble into a fairy realm, only to be met by its just-woken guardian. Grieving characters may find the solutions and solace they seek in Gráinne's magic and power.
    
- **Loot:** Tiara of Pailis
    

Tiara of Pailis (artifact)

 

level 7; allows the wearer to fly a long distance each round (as an action). The wearer can control their speed, direction, and height. Depletion: 1 in 1d20

**GM Intrusion:** A character's companion animal or mount is affected by Gráinne's animal affinity and falls under her power.

### GOBLIN1 (3)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 335)

Goblins are wicked, grasping, and perversely resourceful. Usually no larger than children, they can seem like pesky rabble, but that illusion hides something altogether more cunning. Tribe members work together to accomplish their goals of murder, kidnapping, and theft.

- **Motive:** Greed and theft
    
- **Environment:** Tunnels and caves, usually in groups of ten or more
    
- **Health:** 3
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 2 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks related to perception, stealth, and setting traps as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Goblins attack from the shadows with ambushes and hit-and-run tactics. When they have surprise, they attack as level 4 creatures and deal 2 additional points of damage, and they attempt to draw larger prey into level 5 traps they've previously set. They often flee in the face of real danger.
    
- **Interaction:** Goblins are lying tricksters but can be cowed into cooperating for short periods.
    
- **Use:** Thieves and murderers, goblins are foes to all, even rival goblin tribes.
    
- **Loot:** Aside from weapons, each goblin carries a personal stash, including bones, shiny rocks, sticks, and other bits of worthless trash, plus currency equivalent to an inexpensive item.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The goblin poisoned its knife. If struck, the character must make a Might defense roll or immediately move one step down the damage track.

### GREY4 (12)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 337)

Greys are enigmatic creatures born of alien stars (or dimensions) who have learned to move across the vast distances that bridge neighboring star systems. The creatures descend through the atmosphere under the cover of night to abduct specimens for study and return the victims later after a thorough examination. Returned abductees are usually befuddled and confused, and they retain little memory of what happened to them. Victims of the greys' examination frequently sport strange marks on their flesh, oddly shaped wounds, gaps where teeth used to be, and strange or unknown metal lodged somewhere under the skin.

A grey stands 3 feet (1 m) tall. It has a narrow body with skinny limbs and a large, bulbous head. Two large black eyes, almond shaped, dominate a face that has only a suggestion of a nose and a narrow mouth. Greys wear skintight uniforms, carry numerous instruments to study their environments, and keep a weapon or two for protection.

- **Motive:** Knowledge
    
- **Environment:** Greys land their spacecraft in remote areas, where they have minimal risk of discovery.
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** All tasks related to knowledge as level 6; Speed defense as level 5 due to size and quickness
    
- **Combat:** A grey carries a powerful ray emitter that can burn holes through solid steel. The grey can use the emitter to attack targets within long range. Against dangerous opponents, a grey can use an action to activate a personal shield that encapsulates it in a bubble of force. The shield gives it +3 to Armor, but while the shield is active, the grey can't fire its ray emitter.
    
    Greys are scientists, but cautious ones. Leaving a trail of corpses as evidence of their existence isn't their preferred mode of operation. For this reason, one grey in every group has a memory eraser. When this grey activates the device, each target other than a grey within short range must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or become stunned for one minute, taking no action (unless attacked, which snaps the victim out of the condition). When the effect wears off naturally, the target has no recollection of encountering little grey creatures.
    
- **Interaction:** Greys are curious about the places they visit but reluctant to move or act in the open. Secretive and mysterious, they prefer to observe creatures from afar and, on occasion, pick them up for closer inspection. Someone who offers a grey true knowledge might be treated as an equal rather than a lab animal.
    
- **Use:** The PCs are called to investigate a series of disappearances of animals and people. One by one, the abductees return, usually in odd places, and always bearing physical markings that suggest they were subjected to invasive procedures. To protect others from a similar fate, the PCs must catch the abductors in the act.
    
- **Loot:** A grey has one or two cyphers and might have a memory eraser that works as described under Combat (depletion roll of 1–2 on a 1d10).
    

**GM Intrusion:** A grey's ray emitter suffers a terrible mishap and explodes. The device kills the grey and destroys its body completely. For the next day, creatures that come within a short distance of where the grey died take 4 points of ambient damage from the psychic radiation each round they remain there.

### GUARD2 (6)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 374)

Guards keep the peace but don't usually show much initiative. Ultimately, they do as they're ordered by their superiors, regardless of legality. A guard might be a star trooper dressed in intimidating armor, a mall security guard, a beat police officer, or a mafia goon.

- **Motive:** Keep the peace; follow orders
    
- **Health:** 8
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Armor:** 1 or 2
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Perception as level 3
    
- **Combat:** Guards are not often wily, but they understand strength in numbers. If two or more guards attack the same target with at least one melee attack in the same round, the target's Speed defense roll against those attacks is hindered.
    

When attacked, guards always call for the help of other guards, if possible.

- **Interaction:** Interacting with a guard typically involves one issue: does the PC want to do something that the guard has been told to prevent? If so, the PC could have a difficult time.
    
- **Use:** To the PCs, guards can be allies, obstacles, or both. Guards who serve the public good have their own duties and aren't interested in doing the characters' work for them.
    
- **Loot:** A guard has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition to weapons, armor, and basic gear.
    

**GM Intrusion:** 1d6 local citizens intervene on the guard's behalf, calling for more guards or even fighting the guard's foes.

### HAG6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 111)

Hags are evil magical creatures distantly related to the fey. They resemble withered ancient humans with obvious inhuman features—dead eyes, green or purple skin, metal teeth, webbed fingers, and seaweed-like hair are common traits. They love corrupting pure and innocent things, and feast on the dreams and flesh of their victims.

- **Motive:** Power, treachery
    
- **Environment:** Forests, swamps, mountains, and unpleasant natural locations
    
- **Health:** 25
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Lying, haggling, magical lore, mimicking voices, and Intellect defense as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Hags can attack with their iron-hard claws and teeth, but often rely on their magic abilities in combat. Hags can breathe water, and usually have three or more of the following abilities:
    
    - _Arcane blast:_ Use magical energy to blast one foe within short range and inflict 6 points of damage, or divide this energy (and damage) among several foes as the hag sees fit (each foe makes their own Speed defense roll against this attack).
    - _Change shape:_ Transform into a humanoid or common animal, or return to their own form.
    - _Curse:_ Curse a creature within long range, hindering all physical actions by two steps.
    - _Fear:_ Terrify all creatures within short range who look upon them, causing the creatures to flee for one minute if they fail an Intellect defense roll.
    - _Illusion:_ Create an illusion affecting a small area that includes light, sound, and smell. They can use this to disguise themselves as any humanoid creature (such as a human, dwarf, or elf). Changing or maintaining the illusion is not an action.
    - _Invisibility:_ Turn invisible for ten minutes. When invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks.
    - _Murderous glare:_ Glare at one opponent, causing bloody wounds that inflict 6 points of damage if the creature is within short range (3 points if within long range).
    - _Question:_ Get an answer to a very simple, general question about a creature or place within 1 mile (1.5 km).
    - _Scrying eye:_ View any familiar location within 1 mile as if they were observing it directly.
    - _Sleep:_ Make a creature fall asleep for one minute. Damage or loud noises will wake the creature.
    
    Three or more allied hags form a coven, which allows them to use each other's magical abilities, and usually grants the coven (when working together) one or two additional abilities.
    
- **Interaction:** Hags are evil, greedy, hateful, and cruel. They rarely do things for others unless they benefit in some way, and they like to trick fools into dangerous tasks that end up profiting the hag instead of anyone else. If shown proper respect and bribed or paid, a hag can be a valuable source of lore.
    
- **Use:** The smell of cakes lures children to a mysterious woodland shack. The hag of the swamp is said to kill anyone who enters their territory without carrying a specific gift.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to coins and jewels, a hag usually has several scrolls or potions and may have an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A creature becomes afraid and reluctant to oppose the hag, hindering all actions against the hag by two steps for one day.

### HALFLING3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 136)

A halfling is fond of the comforts of home, but adventures and exploration are the fodder of great stories told over tea or dinner, or in a fireside chat. Quick, resourceful, and easy to get along with, halflings fit right in with brave big folk as scouts, burglars, and loyal companions.

- **Motive:** Defense, comfort
    
- **Health:** 9
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Armor:** 0 or 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Intellect defense, pleasant social interactions, and stealth as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Halflings are remarkably skilled with knives, clubs, slings, and small bows. They prefer not to fight larger creatures head on; instead they stay at range, plan ambushes to quickly overwhelm opponents, or team up with a larger ally so they can attack a foe's back and legs.
    
- **Interaction:** Halflings enjoy the company of larger folks as long as they aren't mocked for their size. They're brave and determined when they need to be, though some might complain about wanting to go home.
    
- **Use:** A young halfling wants to have some adventures before settling down. The local thieves' guild is said to employ halflings as lookouts and cutpurses, sometimes disguised as human children.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their weapons (and perhaps some light armor) and food, a halfling might have an interesting cypher or two. Most carry several useful moderately priced items, or an expensive item such as an heirloom snuff box or a nice bag of tools.
    

### HUNTSMAN/WOODCUTTER2 (6)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 139)

A huntsman may be in the employ of a powerful magic user, protecting a section of the woods they consider their own, or just trying to provide for their family by chopping wood and hunting game.

- **Motive:** Follow orders, support their loved ones, protect the innocent
    
- **Environment:** Woods, forests, and other wild lands
    
- **Health:** 8
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 2 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tracking and pathfinding as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Huntsmen and woodcutters both understand the power of the perfectly aimed shot or swing. They take their time, steady their hand and breath, and hit with precision and force.
    
- **When they ta**ke no action on a turn, their next attack inflicts twice the normal damage. Interaction: Many huntsmen and woodcutters are motivated by a deep need to be loyal, but they're also soft of heart and have a strong moral center. If they're tasked with something they deem unpalatable, they may forgo their promises and go rogue.
    
- **Use:** They are hunting the characters on the orders of a higher authority. They save the PCs from a dangerous foe, then ask for assistance for their own tasks.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their clothing and mundane weapon, they likely have an expensive token of promise or affection from someone they have helped or who they owe fealty to.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A perfectly timed cut sends a tree down in the direction of the character.

### JOTUNN (NORSE GIANT)6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 115)

Jotunns are a type of giant—large, somewhat intelligent, bad-tempered, and cultured in their own way, but generally hostile to humans and other "little folk." Jotunns range from 9 to 20 feet (3 to 6 m) tall, are strong, have long hair, and wear armor and use weapons like humans do. Some are hideous, some are attractive by human standards, and some have multiple heads. They live in caves, lodges, or large castles. There are two main types of jotunns: fire and frost.

#### JOTUNN, FIRE6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 115)

Fire jotunns are often called fire giants. Their skin is coal-grey or black; their hair is red or gold and may be metal or actual flames. They prefer hot mountainous climates (particularly volcanoes), wear plate armor, and use greatswords that glow with the natural heat of their bodies.

- **Motive:** Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor
    
- **Environment:** Hot mountains, volcanic areas, supernatural fires
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points plus 3 points from fire
    
- **Armor:** 3 (immune to fire)
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws objects as level 8
    
- **Combat:** A fire jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant), inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient fire damage conducted from the jotunn's body. Jotunns throw boulders up to very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus 3 points of fire damage.
    
    A jotunn can inflict 1 point of fire damage with a touch, and anyone touching it without protection against fire takes damage as if the jotunn had touched them. A slain fire jotunn and its equipment are too hot to safely touch for several minutes.
    
    Fire jotunns are immune to fire damage, but take additional damage from cold (equal to the attack's normal damage, up to a maximum of 5 additional points of cold damage).
    
    Fire jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to earth and fire.
    
- **Interaction:** Fire jotunns tend to be hostile, but they may agree to a nonlethal challenge to allow visitors to pass through their land or join them for a feast.
    
- **Use:** A fire jotunn decides to cause trouble for intruders in its territory. A clan of jotunns wages war against a fortified village or town, hurling boulders, starting fires, and stealing livestock.
    
- **Loot:** Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils, plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious metals and decorated with gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The jotunn's attack inflicts a serious burn, making a limb useless for an hour or until healed.

#### JOTUNN, FROST6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 116)

Frost jotunns are often called frost giants or ice giants. Their skin is pale white, pink, or blue, and their hair is usually white, pale blond, or actual ice. They prefer cold mountains and tundra, wear chainmail and furs, and use metal axes that channel powerful cold from their bodies.

- **Motive:** Destruction, hungers for flesh, honor
    
- **Environment:** Cold mountains and plains
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points plus 3 points from cold
    
- **Armor:** 2 (immune to cold)
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when skiing
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to size; breaks and throws objects as level 8
    
- **Combat:** A frost jotunn uses weapons appropriate to its size (which would be two-handed for a human but can be wielded one-handed by the giant), inflicting 6 points of damage plus another 3 points of ambient cold damage conducted from the jotunn's body. Jotunns throw boulders or chunks of ice up to very long range, inflicting 6 points of damage plus 3 points of cold damage.
    
    A jotunn can inflict 1 point of cold damage with a touch, and anyone touching it without protection against cold takes damage as if the jotunn had touched them. A slain frost jotunn and its equipment are too cold to safely touch for several minutes.
    
    Frost jotunns are immune to cold damage, but take additional damage from fire (equal to the attack's normal damage, up to a maximum of 5 additional points of fire damage).
    
    Frost jotunn leaders sometimes have magical powers, usually related to illusions and weather.
    
- **Interaction:** Frost jotunns tend to be hostile, but if in a generous mood, they may allow visitors to dine with them or rest in their halls. Once they grant someone hospitality, they are loath to break it unless they are attacked, robbed, or tricked.
    
- **Use:** A frost jotunn throws a boulder just to be threatening. A clever jotunn offers to share a story in exchange for food and conversation. A clan of jotunns uses the cover of a storm to raid a village.
    
- **Loot:** Jotunns like fine things, and their homes usually have utensils, plates, weapons, and trophies made of precious materials and decorated with gems. They may have cyphers, and a leader may carry an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The jotunn's attack numbs one of the character's limbs, hindering all actions with it by two steps until it is healed.

### MAD SCIENTIST4 (12)

(STAY ALIVE!, PAGE 118)

A mad scientist is someone who delves into areas of science best left unexamined, abandoning ethics and pushing for what can be created without asking if it should be.

- **Motive:** Understanding and exploiting reality
    
- **Environment:** Usually in a lab
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Defends as level 6 due to a gadget (or cypher); knowledge of advanced science as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Mad scientists are usually accompanied by security guards, robots, zombies, or some other appropriate creature. A mad scientist can attempt to take command of an enemy's technological device (armor, a weapon, a cypher, a robot, and so on) within short range for up to one minute using a handheld device.
    
    Mad scientists usually have access to a long-range energy or high-velocity weapon that inflicts 7 points of damage. They often carry manifest cyphers that increase Armor, confuse opponents' senses, or transform themselves into a form that eases all their actions by two steps.
    
- **Interaction:** Mad scientists are narcissistic and love to monologue about their work. They negotiate but usually are sociopathic and don't care about other people. Some are filled with self-loathing but too far gone to feel they can change.
    
- **Use:** Blackouts and strange noises have been traced to a location found to hold a secret lab where a scientist is creating something amazing and monstrous.
    
- **Loot:** Mad scientists have a few manifest cyphers and possibly an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The mad scientist produces a gadget or cypher that proves to be the perfect answer to a dilemma at hand.

### MERFOLK3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 119)

Merfolk are intelligent creatures with humanlike bodies from the waist up and scaly fish bodies from the waist down. They are able to breathe air or water but prefer the sea for its beauty and their better mobility. Merfolk have great underwater cities ruled by a king or queen, but most land-walking species interact only with the common or soldier merfolk who visit the ocean surface and coastlines. Merfolk societies are much like those of surface humans; their inability to use fire limits them in some ways (such as blacksmithing), but they have compensated for this with water magic and other skills.

Merfolk skin ranges from all human colors to green, blue, and grey. Some have small fins on their heads and elbows or webs between their fingers. They dress for comfort and wear jewelry made of shells, coral, pearls, polished gemstones, and metals they can salvage or trade for. Most of them are content to be hunters or cultivators of kelp and other aquatic plants, but some are curious about land-walkers (and their sunken ships) or fiercely territorial about protecting their waters against outsiders.

- **Motive:** Defense, entertainment
    
- **Environment:** Oceans, seas, and coasts
    
- **Health:** 9
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Immediate; short when swimming
    
- **Modifications:** Perception as level 4 while in water
    
- **Combat:** Merfolk use spears, tridents, daggers, and other stabbing weapons that are effective underwater. They may create traps using nets to confine or direct foes into an ambush. A few lucky or clever ones have acquired or adapted light crossbows designed to fire underwater up to a short distance away.
    
    About once every ten minutes, a merperson can swim a short distance as their action and still make a melee attack, or swim up to a long distance as their action.
    
    About one in ten merfolk have the magical ability to harden water until it is as strong and durable as wood, taking about an hour to make a spear or similar tool that lasts for several days. Some noble merfolk can create short-range bolts of electricity as an action and make limited alterations to the weather (stilling, increasing, or dispersing wind and clouds in a very long area) by concentrating for several minutes.
    
- **Interaction:** Merfolk react according to their role in merfolk society—farmer, rancher, guard, explorer, noble, and so on. Some merfolk are more aggressive or hostile and dislike the presence of land-walkers in their territory. Most merfolk are amiable to conversation and trade with people who treat them with fairness and respect.
    
- **Use:** Merfolk are often seen sunning themselves on a small island off the coast. Merfolk warriors accompanied by trained large fish have been harassing boats and ships that stray too far from the shallows and shores.
    

Trained large fish

 

level 2; attacks as level 3; swims a long distance each round

- **Loot:** In addition to several small pieces of jewelry, a group of merfolk might have a manifest cypher. A noble or royal merperson usually has a cypher and might have an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusions:** The merfolk's weapon injects poison, inflicting 5 points of Speed damage if the character fails a Might defense task. Another merperson or an allied aquatic creature arrives and joins the fight against the character.

### MORLOCK2 (6)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 121)

Morlocks are degenerate, blind cannibal humanoids that avoid light. They have prominent teeth, piglike eyes, loose skin, and stooped postures. They avoid bright daylight and prefer to hunt and forage when it is dark out (or at least under the twilight-like canopy of a heavy forest). Morlocks eat any sort of meat, even carrion and their own dead. Morlocks build piles of stones to mark their territory. On nights of the new moon, they create unnerving music by playing simple drums made out of skulls and logs. They lack the foresight to store food for lean times, so they range farther from home in winter and times of famine. They are sometimes enslaved by more powerful creatures such as ogres or a vampire.

- **Motive:** Hungers for flesh, defense
    
- **Environment:** Caves, forests, hills, and underground
    
- **Health:** 6
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 2 points
    
- **Movement:** Short; short when climbing
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth and tracking as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Morlocks fight with their nails and teeth, but sometimes they use simple weapons like clubs, stone knives, spears, and javelins if they have observed other humanoids doing so. Some tribes dig simple pit traps and chase prey into them.
    
    Morlocks dislike strong light but are not harmed by it. Their hearing and sense of smell is strong enough that they can "see" in dim or very dim light as if it were normal light. They can track scents as well as a trained dog.
    
- **Interaction:** Morlocks have a simple language of hoots, howls, and growls that communicate basic concepts like food, fire, danger, and cold. If enslaved by a more powerful creature, some of them can manage to learn a few words in that creature's language.
    
- **Use:** Town elders warn that the drums and near-human howls on dark nights are signs of morlocks who'll steal away foolish children. Stacked piles of stones are found in the forest, each surrounded by bare humanoid footprints.
    
- **Loot:** Morlocks don't value what they can't eat, but their lair may have a cypher or two from a recent victim.
    

**GM Intrusion:** An unnoticed morlock drags away an unconscious character or animal to be eaten once they're out of sight.

### NATATHIM (HOMO AQUUS)3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 126)

Genetically engineered to live in the water oceans discovered beneath the ice crusts of various solar moons, natathim (Homo aquus) have human ancestors, but barely look it. Survival in the frigid, lightless depths of extraterrestrial oceans required extreme adaptation. Predominantly dark blue, their undersides countershade to pure white. Though humanoid, their physiology is streamlined, giving their heads a somewhat fish-like shape, complete with gills and large eyes to collect light in the depths. Their bodies are adorned with fins and frills, including a long shark-like tail, and they have webbed extremities with retractable claws.

Depending on the setting, natathim are either human allies with the same (or even more advanced) tech, enemies with the same or more advanced tech, or genetic anomalies treated like laboratory rats burning with genocidal fury at what's been done to them. Alternatively, natathim could be discovered in Earth's deepest oceans, their origin mysterious, but able to interbreed with humans as a method for maintaining their line.

- **Motive:** Just as with humans, natathim have many and varied motivations and drives.
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere in or near water, or in suits/craft with marine environments, in schools of three to twelve. Natathim can act normally in air for up to twenty-four hours before they must return to water.
    
- **Health:** 9
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short on land; long in the water
    
- **Modifications:** Swims as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Natathim attack with their retractable claws or, if available, technological weapons. Some have a magnetoreception ability that allows them to see into frequencies other creatures can't, or even stranger abilities to interact magnetically with their surroundings, though this is little understood.
    
- **Interaction:** Natathim can be sympathetic to humans, partners in space exploration, or consider humans to be bitter foes for having created their species in the first place, depending on the setting.
    
- **Use:** The PCs find evidence of an illegal gene tailoring experiment, with evidence pointing to research being done somewhere in the Opulence of Outer Planets.
    
- **Loot:** Some natathim carry valuable items and equipment.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The natathim spontaneously magnetizes the character's possessions, which hold them helpless against the nearest wall or floor (if also metallic). The PC can take no actions other than attempt to escape.

### NECROMANCER5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 122)

The ability to influence, command, and call up the dead is an impressive power, given how many more people are dead than living. Since the only thing separating a living person from a dead one is a well-aimed knife or death spell, the number of dead always rises.

- **Motive:** Magical power, mastery over death
    
- **Environment:** In places where dead are interred, usually with some number of undead servitors
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 6 due to shroud of undead protective spirits
    
- **Combat:** Necromancers can blast a foe within long range with the cold of the grave or flesh-decaying magic.
    
    A necromancer can cast a death spell on a foe within short range once every minute; the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or move down one step on the damage track. This ability could be an innate power or come from an artifact.
    
    A necromancer who isn't already accompanied by undead spirits or shambling, spirit-inhabited corpses under their command can call up a spirit as an action. A necromancer can command up to five spirits (or newly allied undead, as described below) at a time.
    
    A necromancer can attempt to take command of a spirit or undead creature within short range. They automatically succeed against an unaligned undead target of level 4 or less. If a targeted spirit is already allied with or in service to a PC, the PC must succeed on an Intellect defense roll or lose control of the spirit to the necromancer's will for one minute.
    

Spirit

 

level 3; flesh-decaying touch inflicts 3 points of damage

- **Interaction:** Necromancers are feared for their nonchalant attitudes toward life, especially the life of normal people (such as peasants and city folk). They will negotiate but usually don't have the capacity to care about another person's well-being; they're sociopathic.
    
- **Use:** A character has died, and their allies must find a necromancer to help retrieve their spirit. Of course, the necromancer wants something in return for this aid—perhaps an artifact pilfered from whatever underworld or hell the dead character is imprisoned within.
    
- **Loot:** Necromancers have one or two expensive items, a cypher, and possibly an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character's feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they can succeed on a Might task to escape. Each round the character fails to escape, the hand squeezes them for 3 points of damage.

### NOBLE KNIGHT7 (21)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 123)

Whether noble or ignoble, some knights achieve an amazing mastery over weapons, combat, and courtly graces, eclipsing lesser warriors and champions. The quests of some noble knights can lead them far across the land into strange new territories where they encounter and defeat various magical creatures.

- **Motive:** Accomplish noble (or ignoble) deeds
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere, often alone, sometimes with followers
    
- **Health:** 50
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 10 points
    
- **Armor:** 3
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** All tasks related to heraldic lore and chivalry as level 8; Speed defense as level 8 while holding shield
    
- **Combat:** Noble knights are armed with massive weapons they can wield in one hand, which means they can also hold a shield. They are skilled with melee weapons (such as a battleaxe, broadsword, or mace) and inflict lethal damage on a hit.
    
    Noble knights can also rely on a magic artifact or two to aid them, and possibly a noble steed (Noble steed: level 5; moves a long distance each round). The artifact might be the very weapon a knight wields in combat and could grant them one or more of the following additional abilities:
    
    - _Legendary Strength._ The noble knight can call upon the artifact to grant them great strength or fortitude to accomplish a particular physical task (such as breaking down a door, lifting a boulder, or knocking down pillars holding up a structure), which they attempt as if they were level 10.
    - _Regeneration._ The noble knight regenerates 2 points of health per round while the weapon is drawn.
    - _Resistance._ The noble knight is immune to effects that would influence their mind, charm them, or put them to sleep.
- **Interaction:** Flowery language and impeccable manners show a knight's noble background. Those who negotiate with one in good faith are likely to come away with something of value. However, sometimes a noble knight is corrupt and betrays trusts.
    
- **Use:** A noble knight has decided that they must guard a bridge against any who would cross it.
    
- **Loot:** Noble knights carry weapons, heavy armor, and perhaps a cypher or even an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character damaged by a noble knight's attack must succeed on a Might defense roll or be knocked off a mount, a bridge, or a cliff, or, if nothing suffices, they are knocked to the ground and out of immediate range of the knight.

### OCCULTIST5 (15)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 375)

Paranormal researchers, cultists, secret practitioners of white magic, and coven members might be occultists. Thanks to their study of the metaphysical, occultists learn several magical tricks, including the ability to summon or banish the dead.

- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Knowledge of occult topics and rituals as level 8; ability to detect lies and tricks as level 2
    
- **Combat:** An occultist has a charm or device for summoning a level 5 spirit or demon that will do their bidding for ten minutes. Some also have (or instead have) a spell, item, or device that inflicts 5 points of damage on normal creatures within long range, and 10 points of damage on a demon or spirit (or, instead of dealing extra damage, the effect confines the demon or spirit in some way).
    
- **Interaction:** Occultists are deeply concerned with spiritual or demonic matters and see those influences in all things, whether those influences exist or not. That makes them amenable to persuasion and deception, if couched in the language of spiritual influence.
    
- **Use:** To find a needed answer, the spirit of a dead person must be questioned. Alternatively, a haunting presence must be banished. Either way, the task requires an occultist.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their clothing and mundane weapons, occultists have currency equivalent to an inexpensive item, a cypher, and possibly an artifact related to their power over spirits or demons.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A bony hand erupts from the ground at the character's feet. On a failed Speed defense roll, they are held in place until they succeed on a Might-based task to escape. Each round the character fails to escape, the hand squeezes for 3 points of damage.

### ORC2 (6)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 347)

Born into squalor and fear, the orc species is composed of miserable, misbegotten humanoids that seem destined to serve as fodder for more powerful evil overlords. When left to their own devices, these loathsome creatures turn on each other, the strongest oppressing the next weakest (and so on down the line) with cruel barbs, gruesome jokes, and physical beatings. When these creatures have no masters to hate, they hate themselves.

No two orcs look exactly alike, but all have a mean, ugly, and shambolic facade. Never clean and often spattered with the remains of recent meals, orcs have a mouthful of sharp, broken teeth that can develop into true fangs. Adults range in height from no larger than a human child to massive specimens larger than a strapping man. Whether big or small, nearly all orcs have stooped backs and crooked legs. The hue of their skin is hard to ascertain, because they are covered by the sediment of years, not to mention the iron armor every orc constantly wears from the moment it's able to lift a weapon.

- **Motive:** Make others more miserable than itself
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere near, on, or under mountains, usually in groups of four to six, or in tribes dozens to hundreds strong
    
- **Health:** 7
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 3 when carrying a shield; pleasant interactions as level 1
    

Orcs live short, brutish lives. The few that survive for years do so because of some special advantage; they're sneakier, stronger, tougher, or meaner than average. These have the following modifications, respectively:

- Stealth tasks as level 5
- Deal 2 additional points of damage with melee weapons
- +10 health
- Tasks related to trickery and deceit as level 5

- **Combat:** Most orcs have bows able to target foes within long range. Some carry a shield and wield a medium axe, sword, or mace that inflicts 4 points of damage. Other orcs (usually those that are larger than their fellows) dispense with shields and wield heavy two-handed mauls and hammers that inflict 6 points of damage.
    
- **Interaction:** An orc would stab its own mother if it thought doing so would give it another hour of life in a desperate situation. That said, most orcs have been conditioned, through beatings and torture, to fear the evil master they serve (if any). Characters attempting to negotiate with an orc through intimidation find that short-term success is followed by medium-term betrayal.
    
- **Use:** A band of orcs fires on the PCs from the edge of the forest. However, these orcs are crafty, and characters who rush directly into combat might fall victim to a hidden pit trap or other prepared ambush.
    
- **Loot:** Orcs carry a lot of garbage. Amid this dross, a band of orcs might have currency equivalent to a moderately priced item among them.
    

**GM Intrusion:** With a scream of savage glee, five more orcs rush to join the fight.

### OGRE4 (12)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 346)

A bestial brute, the ogre is a sadistic, 8-foot (2 m) tall, cannibalistic fiend that preys upon other creatures in the woods, mountains, or other wilderness areas. This often pits them against sylvan beings like elves and fey. Ogres dwelling in more civilized lands are also the enemy of humans, but these ogres usually come no closer to civilization than its very fringes.

Ogres typically dress in ragged, piecemeal clothing or nothing at all.

- **Motive:** Hungers for flesh, sadistic
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere, usually alone or (rarely) in a band of three or four
    
- **Health:** 20
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Feats of raw strength as level 6; Intellect defense and seeing through deception as level 3; Speed defense as level 3 due to size
    
- **Combat:** Ogres usually use clubs or large, two-handed weapons with great power. Since they are accustomed to fighting smaller creatures, they are adept at using their size and strength to their advantage. If an ogre strikes a foe smaller than itself, either the victim is knocked back up to 5 feet (1.5 m), or it is dazed, which hinders its next action.
    
    Ogres can also swing their huge weapons in wide arcs, attacking all foes within close range. Defending against this attack is hindered and the attack inflicts 5 points of damage.
    
    Ogres rarely flee from a fight, and only a foe of overwhelming power can force them to surrender.
    
- **Interaction:** Ogres are stupid and cruel. They speak whatever language is most common in the area in which they live, but their vocabulary is extremely limited. They don't like conversation, even with their own kind. Reasoning with them is difficult at best, but sometimes they can be fooled.
    
- **Use:** A solitary ogre is an excellent encounter for a group of first-tier characters. A number of ogres, particularly well-equipped and well-trained warriors, make excellent troops or guards in the service of a powerful master. Evil wizards and warlords like to enslave ogres and place them at the forefront of their armies. In these cases, the ogres are typically bribed, ensorcelled, or intimidated by great force.
    
- **Loot:** Some ogres hoard gold or other valuables in their lairs, but they rarely have use for magic or cyphers.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The ogre's mighty blow (whether it strikes a foe or not) hits the ground or the wall, causing major structural damage and a possible collapse, cave-in, or landslide. It might also expose a hidden underground cave or chamber.

### PALADIN4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 136)

Paladins are heroes who swear a holy oath to vanquish evil. Their power and righteousness are a gift and a heavy burden, and most of them expect to die in battle against an evil foe.

- **Motive:** Protecting the innocent, destroying evil
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2 or 3
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Attacks and Might defense as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Paladins like flashy weapons and shiny armor, which help them show their devotion to the ideals of goodness and draw the attention of evil foes. Many choose a two-handed weapon, but some prefer using a shield in their off hand (defense-oriented paladins like these inflict only 4 points of damage with their attacks but gain an asset on Speed defense).
    
    Blessed by the powers of good, paladins can draw on innate holy magic for several purposes, such as detecting the presence of supernatural evil (demons, evil dragons, undead, and so on), restoring 4 health to themselves or a touched creature, smiting an evil foe to inflict an additional 4 points of damage, or breaking free of mind control.
    
- **Interaction:** Paladins have big personalities and strongly believe in their purpose and goals. They have no tolerance for evil acts and are unwilling to look the other way when their allies want to bend the rules or take advantage of a "grey area." However, they are not fools and won't throw away their lives for nothing.
    
- **Use:** A paladin lays claim to a foe the characters are seeking or have captured. An old paladin is looking for one last villain to smite.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to their weapons and armor, paladins might have one or two cyphers. More experienced ones might be lucky enough to have an artifact (usually a weapon or armor).
    

### POSTHUMAN7 (21)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 129)

Rather than evolving naturally, posthumans advance via a directed jump, designed with smart tools and AI surgeons. With all the advances fantastic technology brings to their genetic upgrade, posthumans are beings whose basic capacities radically exceed regular people. They can't really be considered human any longer; they've transcended humanity, which is why they're also sometimes called transhumans. They're often involved in large-scale projects, such as creating bigger-than-world habitats or spacecraft, or possibly even researching how they might ascend to some still-higher realm of consciousness or being.

- **Motive:** Variable
    
- **Environment:** Alone or in small groups or communities in orbital colonies or other designed locations
    
- **Health:** 50
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 9 points
    
- **Armor:** 4
    
- **Movement:** Short; flies a long distance
    
- **Modifications:** Knowledge tasks as level 9
    
- **Combat:** Posthumans can selectively attack foes up to a very long distance away with bolts of directed plasma that deal 9 points of damage. A posthuman can dial up the level of destruction if they wish, so instead of affecting only one target, a bolt deals 7 points of damage to all targets within short range of the primary target, and 1 point even if the targets caught in the conflagration succeed on a Speed defense roll.
    
    Posthumans can also call on a variety of other abilities, either by small manipulations of the quantum field or by deploying nanotechnology. Essentially, a posthuman can mimic the ability of any subtle cypher of level 5 or less as an action.
    
    Posthumans automatically regain 2 points of health per round while its health is above 0.
    
- **Interaction:** Posthumans are so physically and mentally powerful that they are almost godlike to unmodified people, and either ignore, care for, or pity them. Knowing what a posthuman actually wants is hard to pin down because their motivations are complex and many-layered.
    
- **Use:** A rogue posthuman is researching a method whereby they might portal into the "quantum" realm of dark energy underlying the known universe of normal matter. Despite the revealed risk of antagonistic post-singularity AIs roaming that realm escaping, the posthuman continues their work.
    
- **Loot:** The body of a posthuman is riddled with unrecognizable technologies fused seamlessly with residual organic material—or at least material that grows like organic material used to. Amid this, it might be possible to salvage a few manifest cyphers and an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The posthuman allows acts out of turn, or takes control of a device that the character is about to use against the posthuman.

### PRINCE(SS) OF SUMMER5 (15)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 348)

Fey nobility are as numberless as cottonwood seeds on the June breeze. But that doesn't mean each isn't unique, with a quirky personality and a specific role to play in the mysterious Court of Summer. Demonstrating life, vigor, predation, growth, and competition, the princesses and princes of summer are beings of warmth and generosity, usually. But catch them during the change of the season, and they can be deadly adversaries just as easily. Fey nobles dress in costly diaphanous and flowing garments, and often wear some sign of their noble lineage, such as a circlet or diadem.

- **Motive:** Unpredictable; defend fey territory and prerogatives
    
- **Environment:** Almost any wilderness region alone or commanding a small group of lesser faerie creatures
    
- **Health:** 22
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short; short when gliding on the wind
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks related to deception, disguise, courtly manners, and positive interactions as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Most fey princesses and princes are armed with an elegant sword and possibly a bow carved of silverwood. Also, each knows one or more faerie spells. Faerie spells include the following.
    
    - _Brilliant Smile:_ Target must succeed on an Intellect defense task or do the fey creature's will for up to one minute.
    - _Golden Mead:_ Allies who drink from the fey's flask gain an asset to all defense tasks for ten hours.
    - _Night's Reward:_ Target suffers 5 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor) and must make an Intellect defense roll or fall asleep for up to one minute.
    - _Summer Confidence:_ Selected targets in short range have an asset on tasks related to resisting fear and acting boldly.
    - _Thorns:_ Target suffers 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and must succeed on a Might defense task or lose their next turn entangled in rapidly grown thorny vines.
    
    Princes and princesses of summer regain 2 points of health per round while their health is above 0 unless they've been damaged with a silvered or cold iron weapon.
    
- **Interaction:** Most fey are willing to talk, and those of the Summer Court are especially eager to make deals. However, people who bargain with fey nobles should take care to avoid being tricked.
    
- **Use:** The characters find a fey noble wounded and in need of aid.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to fine clothing, fine equipment, and a considerable sum of currency, a prince or princess of summer might carry a few cyphers and even a faerie artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character is blinded for up to one minute by a shaft of brilliant sunlight unless they succeed on a Might defense task.

### QUEEN6 (18)+

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 126)

Ah, the Evil Queen. Ruler of the land, watcher in the mirror. Full of magic, utterly merciless, and sharp of tongue. Evil and wicked queens abound in fairy tales, from those who have no names and are remembered only for their evil deeds, to those whose names will never be forgotten: Queen Grimhilde, Maleficent, the Queen of Hearts, and the White Witch. These queens seek power for power's sake, not caring what destruction lies in their wake.

Of course, not all queens are evil—just the ones you hear about most often. But they are all powerful in their own way, even if they are forced to hide it by their circumstances. While they too crave power, they seek it in order to protect their lands, their people, and their loved ones.

- **Motive:** Power
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere, but typically in cities and towns, where there are people to admire and fear them
    
- **Health:** 18
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Combat:** Queens almost always carry an artifact of great power, such as a staff, crown, mirror, or sword, that grants them unique abilities and skills.
    
    Queens often have familiars, such as ravens, who fight for or beside them. Most familiars can do 4 points of damage with an attack.
    
    Some queens may also be witches or fey creatures, and thus have the ability to use one or two spells and curses that witches and fey also use.
    

#### QUEENS BY LEVEL

- 6The Red Queen (WAAMH, 127)
- 6The Snow Queen (WAAMH, 126)
- 8Queen Grimhilde (WAAMH, 126)

#### QUEEN GRIMHILDE8 (24)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 126)

Perhaps best known for her attempts to kill Snow White through magic and poison, Grimhilde has other passions and talents as well. She seeks ways to make all beings obey her commands, starting with the huntsman who so stupidly and willfully deceived her so long ago.

- **Environment:** One of her many castles, the woods
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Health:** 18
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Combat:** Her vulture familiars swirl about all foes in short range, knocking them prone and inflicting 4 points of damage. She can use the following witch abilities: glamour, imprison, and seduce.
    

Vulture familiars

 

level 4

- **Interaction:** Grimhilde is cunning and devious, always hatching plans against those who harm her, who threaten to overshadow her, or who have caught her eye in some way.
    
- **Use:** The characters enter an area that is under Grimhilde's power and must face her wrath.
    
- **Loot:** She has a mirror mirror artifact, as well as 1d6 cyphers (often poison).
    

#### THE RED QUEEN6 (18)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 126)

The Red Queen has never once yelled "Off with her head!" In fact, she has never yelled. It's horrible manners, and besides, when you know how to wield power, you don't need all that noise and chaos. You need only whisper and be still, and everyone will politely fall quiet and listen.

- **Environment:** Polite dinner parties and social gatherings
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Combat:** Prefers verbal sparring over the physical sort, and inflicts 3 points of damage with a single cutting remark or sharp-tongued retort.
    
- **Interaction:** The Red Queen is quite proper and chatty, the perfect host and the perfect guest. The only time she ever grows irate is when the subject of her sister, the Queen of Hearts, comes up.
    
- **Use:** While attending a party to steal something, the characters are caught by the Red Queen
    

#### THE SNOW QUEEN6 (18)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 126)

The Snow Queen rules over the "snow bees"—snowflakes that look like bees. She keeps an ornate palace surrounded by gardens in the lands of permafrost, but she can be seen elsewhere in the world where snowflakes cluster. Most say she is cold, and they would be right. She has been part of the snow for so long that it's possible she no longer remembers warmth or kindness or love.

- **Environment:** Anywhere there is snow, ice, or winter
    
- **Armor:** 2 (from personal ice walls)
    
- **Combat:** Creates a snowstorm that blinds all foes in long range for three rounds; ice shards rain down upon all foes in long range, inflicting 2 points of damage; reindeer familiar inflicts 5 points of damage with her horns.
    
- **Interaction:** The Snow Queen is not evil—she just has forgotten what it means to be human, with human needs and human hearts (not that she was ever truly human, but that's a story for another time). She is willing to bargain if she understands what she gets out of it.
    
- **Use:** The Snow Queen guards the entrance to a place the characters need to enter.
    

### SATYR5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 125)

These muscular humanoids sport long curved horns and furry, hooved legs. They are self-centered, greedy, and sybaritic creatures, dedicated to food, drink, and other pleasures. They rob and steal from others as it pleases them, often relying on tricks and lies, or alluring music they play on pipes.

- **Motive:** Play tricks, gather treasure, fulfill desires
    
- **Environment:** Woodlands, hills, and plains
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks related to persuasion and deception as level 7; resists mental attacks as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Satyrs usually carry spears that they can use in melee and against foes within short range. They can also create magical effects by playing their pipes as an action, which can either bolster allies or harm enemies:
    
    - _Dance of the Leaping Stag:_ Foes within short range who fail an Intellect defense task lose their next turn to dancing and leaping. Attacks made against affected targets are eased.
    - _Feral Overture:_ An ally within short range is infused with magic, and one attack it makes on its next turn is eased; if it hits, it inflicts +3 damage.
    - _Tune of the Clouded Mind:_ A foe within short range who fails an Intellect defense task spends its next turn attacking one of its allies.
- **Interaction:** Satyrs are inveterate mercenaries. They gladly work for strong drink and other treasures, and they ally with almost any creature capable of meeting their price. A satyr is always willing to start negotiations, but is prone to lying and exaggeration. Offering excessive libation, food, and other rewards is the only way to ensure that a satyr remains honest, and then for only a short period.
    
- **Use:** Strange piping music in the forest lures away young people from a nearby community. Community elders say a charismatic cult leader has set up in the woods and clouds the minds of all who come near.
    
- **Loot:** A satyr is likely to carry one or two cyphers.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A mental effect makes the character view the satyr as a good friend for up to one minute unless they succeed at an Intellect defense task.

### SCHOLAR2 (6)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 140)

Scholars might be librarians, sages, wise women, crones, experts, or soothsayers. Typically, scholars seek knowledge above all else, and many also are willing to share it with others (sometimes for a price, sometimes just for the joy of sharing knowledge). A scholar's expertise might be general or specific—they may study the world at large or home in on a specific type of magic or fey being, for example.

- **Motive:** Find answers, seek knowledge
    
- **Environment:** Schools, libraries, the royal study, laboratories, and anywhere there are sources of information
    
- **Health:** 6
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Intuition, persuasion, detecting falsehoods, and most knowledge tasks as level 4
    
- **Combat:** Scholars prefer to avoid a fight. If they must fight, a scholar tries to deduce a foe's weaknesses (if any) and exploit them in combat. Some scholars might have learned spells or abilities from those they've studied. Others might be examining a useful cypher or artifact, and will use it on their attackers.
    
- **Interaction:** Most scholars are helpful and full of information (whether or not it's useful or true information varies from scholar to scholar). What they don't know, they may be willing to learn or study, if given the proper tools and incentive. However, some scholars are secretive, hoarding their knowledge for their own personal uses.
    
- **Use:** Scholars can be incredible allies, offering clues, hints, and information that can help the characters. However, they may be reclusive and hard to find, hidden away in ancient libraries or secret laboratories.
    
- **Loot:** Most scholars have currency equivalent to a very expensive item and one or two cyphers.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Something the scholar is studying comes alive, creating havoc and disarray throughout the area.

### SECRET AGENT5 (15)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 375)

Secret agents are trained professionals who put their mission before their own well-being, regardless of which government agency, corporation, guild, or kingdom employs them. An agent operates under a fake cover, perhaps as an envoy, inspector, technician, actor, tourist, or bumbling fool.

- **Motive:** Accomplish the goals of the employer while maintaining cover
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks related to disguise and deceiving as level 6
    
- **Combat:** A secret agent always has a covert, unexpected backup weapon that they can use to make a surprise attack, such as a ring or glove with a hidden poisoned needle (dealing 5 points of Speed damage that ignore Armor), a fake tooth filled with poison gas to blow in a victim's face (inducing sleep for ten minutes), or a ring with a miniature gun.
    
- **Interaction:** Secret agents are confident, masterful, and always give the impression of being one step ahead of the game, even when caught off guard.
    
- **Use:** As an ally, a secret agent can guide the PCs to their next mission, fill in gaps in their knowledge, and warn them of dangers. If the characters encounter an unfriendly agent, the NPC likely pretends to be a friend.
    
- **Loot:** Agents typically have currency equivalent to an expensive item, a couple of cyphers, tools for spying and maintaining their cover, and possibly an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The secret agent produces a cypher that, for the rest of the day, eases all tasks by two steps.

### SHADOW ELF4 (12)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 352)

Elves who faded from the surface to escape the justice of their fey cousins for crimes uncounted are sometimes called shadow elves, dark elves, or simply trow. It's widely assumed that shadow elves fled to new realms deep below the ground, and indeed, the routes that lead to their true abodes are mostly subterranean and include many grand underground keeps. However, the heart of the shadow elf kingdom lies in the colorless dimension of Shadow itself, where all things exist as a dim reflection of the real world.

Sometimes shadow elves appear on the surface, spilling from dark tunnels or, in some cases, from the shadows themselves. They raid for plunder, fresh slaves, and sacrifices. The sacrifices are made to their godqueen, a monstrously sized black widow spider that schemes in darkness.

When a shadow elf returns to the world of light, it can choose to appear as a silhouette only: a slender humanoid outline lurking as if at the nadir of a well.

- **Motive:** Tortures for pleasure, serve the shadow elf godqueen
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere dimly lit, singly or in groups of up to four
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth and perception as level 6; Speed defense as level 6 due to shadowy nature
    
- **Combat:** Shadow elves attack with short blades, knives, and crossbow quarrels of steel-hard shadow. They can see in dim light and absolute darkness as if it were daylight.
    
    If subject to full daylight, a shadow elf loses its modifications to stealth, perception, and Speed defense, and is likely to retreat.
    
    Some shadow elves can cast spells, including the following. Each spell requires an action to cast.
    

Shadow Elf Spells

|d6|Shadow Elf Spell|
|---|---|
|1|Enchant weapon to inflict 3 additional points of damage (8 total)|
|2|Enchant weapon to inflict 1 additional point of Speed damage (poison, ignores Armor), plus 2 points of Speed damage each additional round until victim succeeds on a Might defense roll|
|3|Fly a long range each round for ten minutes|
|4|Gain +2 to Armor (total of 3 Armor) for ten minutes|
|5|Long-range spell renders subject blind for ten minutes on failed Might defense roll|
|6|Long-range spell targets up to three creatures next to each other; holds them motionless in a shadow web for one minute on failed Speed defense rolls|

- **Interaction:** Shadow elves may negotiate and even ally with other creatures for a time. But they do so only until the best opportunity for a betrayal presents itself.
    
- **Use:** Shadow elves have overrun an outlying keep, and even in broad daylight, the castle is shrouded in darkness and webs of shadow. The treasures said to lie in the keep's coffers may already be in the hands of the dark fey.
    
- **Loot:** A shadow elf carries currency equivalent to an expensive item, in addition to weapons, light armor, and a cypher or two. Shadow elf leaders may carry an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The shadow elf casts a spell that charms a character on a failed Intellect defense roll. The character fights on the side of the shadow elf for up to one minute, though they can make another Intellect defense roll each round to try to break the influence.

**Editor's Notes —** See also: Elf.

### STORM MARINE4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 134)

The storm marine creed is an oft-repeated mantra, "I will never quit, knowing full well that I might die in service to the cause." Wearing advanced battlesuits, hyped up on a cocktail of experimental military drugs, and able to draw on a suite of cybernetic and network-connected drone guns, few things can stand before a storm marine fireteam. Storm marines usually work for nation-states, conglomerates, and similar entities. They mercilessly conduct their mission, even if that mission is to wipe out a rival. Storm marines that question their orders are quickly dispatched by their fellows.

- **Motive:** Achieve mission goals
    
- **Environment:** Alone in or in fireteams of three, anywhere nation-states or similar entities have a financial or military interest
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Armor:** 4
    
- **Movement:** Long; flies a long distance each round
    
- **Modifications:** Perception as level 6; attacks as level 5 due to combat targeting neuro-wetware.
    
- **Combat:** Thanks to their battlesuit, a storm marine has many options in combat. They can deploy an electrified blade to attack every foe in immediate range as a single action, or use a long-range heavy energy rifle that inflicts 6 points of damage.
    
    A storm marine can deploy two level 3 gun drones that fire energy rays at two different targets up to 800 m (2,600 feet) away, inflicting 6 points of damage. If the drones focus on a single target, a successful hit deals 9 points of damage and moves the target one step down the damage track. The drones can attack only once or twice before returning to their cradles in the storm marine's suit for several rounds to recharge.
    
- **Interaction:** A storm marine might negotiate, but getting one to act against their mission is difficult.
    
- **Use:** A fireteam of storm marines are sent to eliminate the PCs or someone the PCs know on suspicion of being radical elements that need to be dealt with.
    
- **Loot:** Though bio-locked to each storm marine, someone who succeeds on a difficulty 8 Intellect task to reprogram the suit could gain a battlesuit of their own, minus the drones (which fly off or detonate).
    

**GM Intrusion:** A character targeting a gun drone rather than the storm marine hits the drone, but the drone reacts by darting to the character and exploding, inflicting 6 points of damage to the character and anyone standing within immediate range.

#### ANATHEMA7 (21)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 356)

The supervillain called Anathema is big, bright red, and stronger than anyone on this planet or any other (or so he claims). Superheroes who go head to head with him learn that he can withstand almost any hit and always gives back twice as hard as he receives. He can bring down buildings with a punch and throw semi trucks across state lines.

Before he was Anathema, he was Sameer Stokes, a bitter and spiteful coder working for a large software company. Having failed in relationships, promotions, and retaining friends, Sameer retreated online and learned that he had power when he bullied people. He delighted in causing emotional distress in others in forums and social media. In effect, he was a troll. When the metamorphosis happened, he was turned into a troll for real. (Sameer doesn't recall the metamorphosis or the days before and immediately after his change, despite using therapy and drugs in an attempt to recover those memories.)

Assume that Anathema has three Power Shifts in strength and two in resilience. These shifts are already figured into his modifications and other stats.

- **Motive:** Accumulate wealth, live on the edge
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere vast wealth can be stolen
    
- **Health:** 70
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 12 points
    
- **Movement:** Short; a few miles (5 km) per leap
    
- **Modifications:** Strength tasks as level 10; Might defense as level 9; Speed defense as level 5 due to size
    
- **Combat:** Anathema hits foes with bone-shocking force. He can throw cars and large objects at targets within long range, dealing damage to all creatures within immediate range of his target.
    
    Anathema has a healing factor that makes it hard to hurt him in any meaningful sense. He regains 10 points of health per round. In any round in which he regains health, his attacks deal 3 additional points of damage (15 total), and he seems to visibly swell with muscle.
    
- **Interaction:** When Anathema is riled up during a fight, it's difficult to reason with him. However, he is willing to negotiate if someone offers him wealth or convinces him they have valuable secrets for breaking mental blocks. Anathema doesn't know how he became the way he is, and he wants to recover his missing memories.
    
- **Use:** The rolling earthquake afflicting the city is actually Anathema fighting a group of newbie superheroes who haven't figured out that engaging the red mountain will likely cause more deaths than leaving him alone. (The first rule of fighting Anathema is to lead or move him somewhere with a low population density.)
    
- **Loot:** Anathema doesn't normally carry wealth or other valuables. In his lair, Anathema typically has three to five expensive items, 1d6 cyphers, and possibly an artifact.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Anathema's attack sends the character flying a long distance and potentially into dangerous terrain.

#### DOCTOR DREAD7 (21)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 357)

Doctor Dread is larger than life thanks to her brilliant mind, her media savvy, and the robotic armor she uses to enhance her otherwise normal abilities. Indeed, Doctor Dread has become the most feared terrorist on the planet. She uses her abilities to extort money, influence, and technology from the rich and powerful, whether her victims are individuals, governments, corporations, or superheroes.

Alicia Coleridge is Doctor Dread's secret identity. Born into relative obscurity, she received a full scholarship to the Russell Institute of Technology, where she studied the effects of radioactive substances on living tissue. In a freak lab accident, Alicia's fiancé was slain, and Alicia was disfigured and driven slightly insane, so much so that she built the Doctor Dread armor. She plows the vast wealth she accumulates through terrorism into research into the rejuvenation of dead flesh. She hopes to one day bring back her dead love, whose body she keeps in suspended animation.

Doctor Dread is usually accompanied by a handful of robot minions.

Dread's robot minion

 

level 3; Armor 1; long-range laser attack inflicts 4 points of damage

Assume that Doctor Dread has three Power Shifts in intelligence and two in resilience. These shifts are already figured into her modifications and other stats.

- **Motive:** Accumulate wealth; reanimate dead flesh
    
- **Environment:** Wherever money can be extorted
    
- **Health:** 40
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 4
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when flying
    
- **Modifications:** Resists mental attacks and deception as level 8; understands, repairs, and crafts advanced technology as level 10
    
- **Combat:** Doctor Dread's armor allows her to exist without outside air (or air pressure), food, or water for up to ten days at a time. She can call on her robotic armor to accomplish a variety of tasks, including the following:
    
    - _Barricade:_ Establish an immobile, two-dimensional field of transparent force 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) for ten minutes
    - _Energy Cloak:_ Create an energy field that gives her +5 to Armor against heat, cold, or magnetism (one at a time, chosen when she uses the power) for ten minutes
    - _Fade:_ Become invisible for one minute, or until she makes an attack
    - _Plasma Blast:_ Long-range heat and electricity blast that inflicts 7 points of damage
- **Interaction:** Doctor Dread is slightly mad, but that's normally disguised by her amazing brilliance. She is an egomaniac but will negotiate in return for a promise of wealth or biomedical lore she doesn't already know.
    
- **Use:** The PCs are called to handle a hostage situation at a party in which many of the city's wealthy elite are being held captive by Doctor Dread. She promises to let them go once sufficient wealth is paid into her offshore accounts.
    
- **Loot:** Most of Doctor Dread's considerable wealth is tied up in online accounts, two or three secret fortresses, and cutting-edge biological research equipment.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Doctor Dread uses a function built into her robotic armor that is the perfect solution for her current predicament: healing herself, teleporting away, disintegrating a barrier, or whatever is needed.

#### MAGNETAR8 (24)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 358)

Not much is known about Magnetar other than its powerful ability to generate and control magnetic fields. Various research groups theorize that Magnetar is an alien, a sentient and self-improving robot, or even some kind of manifestation of a fundamental force. Given Magnetar's vaguely humanoid shape, a few people even suggest that the villain is actually a man with a mutant ability so powerful that it burned out all memories of his former self.

In truth, Magnetar is the animate, sentient, and self-regulating nucleus of a neutron star that is able to rein in its immense electromagnetic signature. One of two such beings an advanced alien species created from a single magnetar (a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field), Magnetar was sent on a mission of exploration. After millennia, it crashed on Earth and was damaged. Having lost most of its memory data, Magnetar knows that something was taken from it (its twin), but it can't remember what. It has decided to blame the humans.

Assume that Magnetar has three Power Shifts in its magnetic power and two in resilience. These shifts are already figured into its modifications and other stats.

- **Motive:** Revenge; regain memory
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere, searching for what it has lost
    
- **Health:** 50
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 12 points
    
- **Armor:** 8
    
- **Movement:** Short; long when magnetically levitating
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to mass; tasks related to controlling and shaping metal through electromagnetic manipulation as level 11
    
- **Combat:** Magnetar's fist packs a wallop, since it can selectively add mass to the punch. However, its most potent ability is its level 11 control over all metal within very long range, which it uses to create anything it can imagine, including walls, attacks, pincers, and more. Magnetar can lift bridges, vehicles, and structures infused with rebar that it can see within its area of influence. When it throws such a large object as part of an attack, the target and everything within short range of the target takes 10 points of damage.
    
    Magnetar's only weakness is psychic attacks, which is fortunate since reducing it to 0 health through an old-fashioned beating could release an uncontrolled neutron star chunk on the Earth's surface.
    
- **Interaction:** Morose and gruff, Magnetar would rather be alone, but every so often, it goes on a rampage, hoping that a display will draw out whoever or whatever made it the way it is. Magnetar constantly feels the drag of emotional loss, but it doesn't know why (it doesn't realize that the feeling comes from the loss of its twin).
    
- **Use:** Doctor Dread has put a bounty on Magnetar's head because she wants to study the advanced technology woven through its body. The bounty amount is outrageous, but then again, so is Magnetar.
    

**GM Intrusion:** On a failed Might defense roll, all of the character's loose metallic items (including weapons) are stripped from them and become stuck to a nearby metallic buttress.

#### MISTER GENOCIDE5 (15)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 359)

Real name Alfred Webster, Mister Genocide has the unfortunate ability to synthesize deadly poison from his skin. His touch can kill, but if he wishes it, so can his spittle or even his breath.

Anyone who spends too much time in Mister Genocide's presence becomes ill, even if the villain isn't actively using his power. Thus, his cronies usually wear gas masks and protective clothing. Mister Genocide has promoted himself to the head of the mob in the city where he resides and is always looking to expand his operations, sometimes at the expense of other criminals.

When victims are killed by Mister Genocide's poison, their skin and the whites of their eyes take on a bright green hue, which increases the terror that normal people feel regarding him. Even superheroes have been brought down by his toxins.

Mister Genocide sometimes teams up with Anathema, because the red mountain is the only villain who can withstand the poison that Genocide constantly emits.

Assume that Mister Genocide has two Power Shifts in his poison power, one in intelligence, and two in resilience. These shifts are already figured into his modifications and other stats.

- **Motive:** Accumulate power
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere crime lords congregate
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points; see Combat
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Poison breath attack and Might defense as level 7; Intellect defense and evil genius as level 6
    
- **Combat:** Targets touched by Mister Genocide must make a difficulty 7 Might defense roll or take 5 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) from the poison transmitted. Worse, the poison continues to inflict 2 points of Speed damage each round until the victim succeeds at a Might defense roll.
    
    Every other round, Mister Genocide can make a level 7 poison attack that can affect up to ten victims within short range as a single action. Those who fail a Might defense roll take 7 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) and spend a round helpless as they cough and gag. The inhalant poison does not continue to inflict damage each round.
    
    Mister Genocide is immune to most venoms, toxins, and poisons.
    
- **Interaction:** Certifiably insane, Mister Genocide likes to kill people. He may negotiate for a while, but if there is not enough gain to be had, he might kill everyone with a breath just for the fun of watching them suffocate and turn green.
    
- **Use:** Gang warfare between two criminal organizations is shooting up downtown, and many innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire end up bullet-ridden or poisoned (with green skin). Someone needs to put a stop to Mister Genocide.
    
- **Loot:** The supervillain carries currency equivalent to 1d6 expensive items, a cypher or two, and a variety of poisoned knives, needles, and vials.
    

**GM Intrusion:** A character affected by the poison must make a second Might defense roll or fall unconscious from shock. Unconsciousness lasts for up to a minute, or until the victim is jostled awake.

#### WRATH6 (18)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 360)

The head of an elite group of assassins, Wrath wants to save the world by killing everyone who impedes her vision of perfection—which turns out to be the better part of humanity. In addition to being one of the most accomplished martial artists to walk the earth (thanks to her connection with a mystical entity called the Demon), Wrath is also a criminal mastermind whose assassins are just one layer of the organization she controls.

Born more than two hundred and fifty years ago in China to a name lost to history, Wrath was taken in by a monastery and trained in the ways of fist and sword. Everything changed when raiders attacked and killed everyone in her monastery, leaving her the sole survivor. Vowing revenge against the raiders and the world that allowed animals like them to exist, she acquired a magical amulet that contains the Demon. The Demon in turn bequeathed her extraordinary speed, strength, and longevity.

Wrath is content to let her assassins (and mobsters, lawyers, and politicians) accomplish many of her goals, though she relishes being present when particularly important adversaries are brought down.

Assassin of Wrath

 

level 4; stealth as level 7

Assume that Wrath has two Power Shifts in dexterity, two in accuracy, and one in resilience. These shifts are already figured into her modifications and other stats.

- **Motive:** Save the world
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere wrongs (to Wrath's way of thinking) must be righted
    
- **Health:** 36
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth, attacks, and Speed defense as level 8
    
- **Combat:** Wrath prefers a sword, though she is equally adept with a crossbow or, in rare cases, modern weapons. In melee she can attack two foes as a single action every round.
    
    Thanks to the influence of the Demon, Wrath regains 3 points of health each round, even if reduced to 0 health. The only way to permanently kill her is to reduce her to 0 health and keep her that way long enough to burn away the tattoo of the Demon that is engraved across her back.
    
- **Interaction:** Wrath is arrogant and confident, though not so much that she is easily fooled by flattery. She is usually amenable to negotiating, because she can anticipate the agenda of others and usually gain far more for herself in the end. However, she is not one to betray her word.
    
- **Use:** Wrath is making a bid to form a group of supervillains—all of whom will answer to her, of course—and it seems that initial talks are going well. The only holdout is Mister Genocide, who feels threatened by Wrath's larger organization, and this tension has led to ongoing warfare in the streets as assassins battle mobsters.
    
- **Loot:** In addition to weapons and armor, Wrath likely possesses the equivalent of five exorbitant items, 1d6 cyphers, and possibly one or two artifacts.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Just as things seem bleakest for her, Wrath summons a group of assassins waiting in the wings to surround the PCs and demand their surrender.

### SYNTHETIC PERSON5 (15)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 137)

Synthetic people have been called many things, including simply synths, androids, robot mimics, and, depending on how they act, killer robots. Their origins are varied. In some cases, they're the result of corporate research into "products" that would serve humanity as assistants and companions, but later gained sentience. In other cases, synthetic people are the result of a state-sponsored program to develop war machines or automated assassins that looked like regular people. Another origin for synthetic people is through the design of awakened (and inimical) AIs as part of an effort to kill off all regular biological people. Now they roam their environment looking like anyone else. Some synths try to fit into whatever kind of society they can find. Some may not even know that they are not human. Others are bitter, homicidal, or still retain their programming to kill. Some of these may have even shed some or all of their synthetic skins to reveal the alloyed mechanisms beneath.

- **Motive:** Varies
    
- **Environment:** Nearly anywhere, out in plain sight or disguised as a human alone, or in gangs of three to four
    
- **Health:** 24
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Long
    
- **Modifications:** Disguise and one knowledge task as level 6
    
- **Combat:** A punch from a synthetic person can break bones. In addition, some synths (especially of the killer variety) can generate a red-hot plasma sphere once every other round and throw it at a target within long range. The target and all other creatures within immediate range of the target must succeed on a Speed defense task or take 7 points of damage.
    
    A synth can take a repair action and regain 10 points of health. A synthetic person at 0 health can't repair itself thusly, but unless the creature is completely dismembered, one may spontaneously reanimate 1d10 hours later with 4 points of health.
    
- **Interaction:** Synthetic people that pretend to be (or think that they are) human interact like normal people. But an enraged one or one that's been programmed to kill is unreasoning and fights to the end.
    
- **Use:** A group of refugees who need help turn out to include (or be entirely made up of) synthetic people. Whether or not any of them harbor programs that require that they kill humans is entirely up to the GM.
    
- **Loot:** One or two manifest cyphers could be salvaged from a synth's inactive form.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character is blinded for one or two rounds after being struck by the synth's searing plasma ball.

### RAIDER3 (9)+

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 107)

Stripped of humanity by brutal living conditions and their determination to survive no matter the cost, raiders still look human. But beneath that veneer, they're feral.

- **Motive:** Raid and kill for what they want
    
- **Environment:** Groups of four to six roaming the ruins
    
- **Interaction:** If a raider believes a just met survivor has food, water, or shelter, or might prove to be a threat immediately or at any later date, they laugh off any suggestion of parley and attack.
    
- **Use:** The raider encampment has a new leader, a warlord whose presence doubles raider activity.
    

#### FELL RIDER3 (9)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 107)

Motorcycle riding raiders keep their "motor wheels" alive through constant tinkering and repair. The two wheeled machines are modified with spears, spikes, lances, and sometimes guns and flamethrowers. Fell riders wear heavy protective garments made from fur, salvaged clothing, and leather from past targets. Goggles protect their eyes, and bones are sewn through their wild, greasy hair as decoration.

- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short; long while riding motorcycle
    
- **Modifications:** Motorcycle repair and modification as level 5; stealth tasks as level 0 due to screaming engines
    
- **Combat:** Using pikes, spears, or lances welded to the front of their bike, a fell rider typically makes ride-by attacks against foes from just outside short range. A fell rider is one with their bike, always moving to engage and disengage. If knocked from their bike (possibly a minor effect), a fell rider's attacks and Speed defenses are hindered until they regain the seat as their action. Some riders use larger four-wheeled vehicles with open canopies instead of motorcycles. These fell riders have 2 Armor and can attempt a run-down attack on up to three targets that are next to each other and not in a vehicle, inflicting 8 points of damage. Struck targets that fail a Might defense roll descend one step on the damage track.
    
- **Loot:** A fell rider's motorcycle, when repaired, is a useful vehicle with enough gas for miles of travel.
    

#### MARAUDER3 (9)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 107)

Marauders are raiders who attack with stealth, wrapping themselves in light smothering clothes and targeting survivors after midnight. By day, they act like regular people, part of a survivor community. That's pretense; when time allows, they torture targets to death and take flesh trophies.

- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points; see Combat
    
- **Movement:** Short; short when climbing
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth and deception tasks as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Marauders use stealth and the night to position themselves before attacking, hoping to make their initial attack with surprise using bladed weapons. Whether they have surprise or not, if they attack before their target's first action, their attacks are eased and inflict 6 points of damage.
    
    Marauders often dose their bladed weapons with poison, so targets must also make a Might defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) each round for three rounds.
    

#### WARLORD5 (15)

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 108)

A warlord enjoys supreme authority over other raiders. Brutal rulers, warlords are a living symbol of power and strength where survival is valued above all else.

Warlords caparison themselves in trophies of vanquished enemies—such as gilded skulls or flayed skins. Some wear garish helms designed to intimidate. An impressive weapon, especially something from the before times, is always close at hand. A warlord is rarely encountered without raiders and other lackeys that fight for and serve them.

- **Motive:** Control through fear and brutality
    
- **Environment:** Usually in the company of five to twenty raiders
    
- **Health:** 25
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 3
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Defends as level 6 due to nearby raiders willing to take no actions other than defend the warlord
    
- **Combat:** Warlords attack twice each round with bladed or spiked melee weapons or ranged firearms. When possible, they fight from an open canopy vehicle (driven by another raider).
    
    A warlord directly leads the raiders they command, fighting at the forefront but also issuing orders. Underlings deal 1 additional point of damage when the warlord can see them and issue commands.
    
    Most warlords have a specific additional advantage they can pull out to win a fight. See the table below.
    

Unique Warlord Advantage

|d6|Advantage|
|---|---|
|1|_Rocket launcher (level 7):_ long-range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on targets in an immediate area (depletion: 1–2 in 1d6)|
|2|_Fire thrower (level 7):_ immediate-range weapon inflicts 7 points of damage on all targets within immediate range (depletion: 1 in 1d10)|
|3|_Release the beast:_ Gives the command to "release the beast"; a melted loyal to warlord charges into the fight|
|4|_Force shield (level 5):_ Static field blocks all incoming attacks against the warlord for one round (depletion: 1–2 in 1d10)|
|5|_Power gauntlet:_ Warlord's power gauntlet grabs foe and automatically deals damage from crushing until foe escapes|
|6|_Skystrike:_ Calls in a "skystrike" from a battered wristband; a round later, a missile launched from a before-times satellite strikes nearby, inflicting 10 points of damage on all creatures within a short area who fail a Speed defense roll, and 2 points on those who succeed (depletion: automatic)|

- **Interaction:** Warlords have lackeys and lieutenants that interact with outsiders. They prefer to make pronouncements and threats from on high.
    
- **Use:** The museum, lab, or other important structure the characters wanted to visit to carry out their mission has fallen under the control of a warlord and a dozen or more raiders.
    
- **Loot:** A warlord may carry an artifact.
    

### REPLICANT5 (15)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 351)

Virtually identical to adult humans, these biosculpted androids are stronger, faster, and potentially smarter. However, because they are manufactured beings with grafted memories, replicants rarely feel true human emotion, be that love, sadness, or empathy, though those who live long enough to lay down their own memories can develop the capacity to do so.

However, few replicants gain the opportunity because they are created for a purpose, which could be to serve as police or guards, as soldiers in a distant war, or as impostors shaped to blend in with people so they can explore on behalf of an alien intelligence or a bootstrapped AI. In most of these cases, these purposes lead to a relatively short span of existence, which usually ends when the replicant chooses to detonate itself rather than be captured.

- **Motive:** Go unnoticed; stamp out (or replace) any who learn of their existence
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere
    
- **Health:** 18
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Tasks related to pleasant social interaction, understanding human social norms, and deception as level 2
    
- **Combat:** Replicants blend in and prefer not to enter combat. Since destruction is not usually their principal goal, they avoid confrontation. If, however, something threatens their mission, they defend themselves to the best of their ability. Replicants might use weaponry but are adept in using their limbs to batter foes into submission.
    
    A replicant poses the greatest danger when its physical form begins to fail through violence or natural degradation (many seem to have a natural "life" span of just a few years). When reduced to 0 points of health, the replicant explodes, inflicting 10 points of damage to everything in long range.
    
- **Interaction:** Replicants are designed to look human and, at least during a casual interaction, pass as human. But extended conversation trips up a replicant more often than not. Eventually, a replicant gets something wrong and says inappropriate things or exhibits strange mannerisms.
    
- **Use:** A contact of one of the characters is secretly a replicant. It has survived longer than expected, and its connection to whatever created it has weakened enough that it has gained some independence and made strong emotional connections to the PC. It knows its time is running out and may turn to the character for help.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character struck by the replicant is smashed into the wall so hard that the surrounding structure begins to collapse on them.

### ROBBER4 (12)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 139)

Robbers, thieves, highwaymen, robin hoods—whatever name you call them, they want what you have, and they're willing to get it any way they can. Some robbers are honorable, stealing only from the rich or the evil. Others will take anything that isn't nailed down or magically protected.

Robbers often travel in pairs or small groups of dedicated friends and fellow robbers.

- **Motive:** What's yours is mine
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere there's something to be stolen
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 2 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth, including sneaking, stealing, hiding, and deception, as level 5; attacking from hiding as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Robbers typically prefer light and medium weapons, particularly bows and small blades.
    
- **Interaction:** Most robbers have a moral code of some sort—it just may not be the code that others abide by. Still, they are willing to listen to reason (and particularly the sound of sliding coins). Robbers are often willing to be hired for jobs that are too difficult for others.
    
- **Use:** Robbers happen upon the place where the characters have made camp, and ask to join them. A group of robbers arrives to steal a thing that the characters are just about to steal themselves.
    
- **Loot:** Depending on whether they've just robbed someone or not, robbers may have anywhere from nothing (other than their weapons and clothing) up to the currency equivalent of a very expensive item.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The robber's arrow manages to hit two foes in a single attack, or the robber shoots two arrows at multiple foes.

**Editor's Notes —** In [We Are All Mad Here](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/we-are-all-mad-here/), this creature is listed as _Thief/Robber_. It is identified by its unique name here to prevent confusion with the Thief.

### THIEF4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 137)

A thief takes things that don't belong to them—preferably with their victim remaining unaware of the crime until the thief is safely away. Burglars and pickpockets are the most common sort, but ambitious thieves are known to plan elaborate heists to steal priceless items from prominent targets.

- **Motive:** Greed, curiosity, risk
    
- **Health:** 12
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** Balancing, climbing, perception, pickpocketing, and stealth as level 5
    
- **Combat:** Thieves prefer small concealable weapons—knives, batons, and so on—so they can quickly make themselves look like an innocent bystander. Their goal is to escape, not kill, so they often rely on tricks like caltrops, spilled oil, and smoke pellets to distract or delay foes and give themselves an opportunity to get away. They aren't above using poison, typically a sleep poison that knocks out a foe for ten minutes on a failed Might defense task.
    
- **Interaction:** Thieves run a broad range of personalities—nervous, arrogant, quietly confident, sarcastic, and more. They like to know the risks and rewards of what they'll be doing, and they don't like surprises.
    
- **Use:** A cocky thief steals an item from a character and returns it to prove their skills are up to the task. A gang of pickpockets targets a character's jewelry or cyphers.
    
- **Loot:** Thieves usually carry light tools, a few small weapons, miscellaneous equipment for creating a distraction, and a cypher they plan to use or sell.

### THUG3 (9)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 376)

Thugs are usually rough, crude, and harsh individuals who prey on those who follow the rules. A thug might be a streetwise drug dealer, a bandit who hunts lone travelers in the wilds, a savage warrior adroit with ranged weapons, or a cyberbully among pacifists. Most thugs work for themselves, but they may employ gangs of guards to help them conduct their business.

- **Motive:** Take what they want
    
- **Health:** 9
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Combat:** Thugs prefer ambushes, making ranged attacks from hiding if possible. Sometimes they spoil the ambush to issue an ultimatum before attacking: give us your valuables or you'll be sorry.
    
- **Interaction:** Thugs are interested in money and power, which means they almost always accept bribes. If faced with a real threat, thugs usually retreat.
    
- **Use:** Thugs are everywhere, sometimes accompanied by guards who are equally malicious but not quite as powerful.
    
- **Loot:** A thug has currency equivalent to an inexpensive item in addition to weapons, shields, and light armor. One thug in a group might have a cypher.
    

**GM Intrusion:** Another thug, hidden until just the right moment, appears and takes a shot with a ranged weapon before joining the fray.

### TIN WOODMAN7 (21)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 113)

Once an ordinary woodman of flesh and blood named Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman's story is a sad one. His beloved axe was enchanted by a wicked witch in order to keep him from his other true love (it's a long story, but suffice it to say that witches who are wicked do wicked things). His beloved axe turned on Nick Chopper, taking off one limb after another. A tinsmith kindly replaced Nick's missing body parts (except his heart) with tin prosthetics, but eventually nothing was left of the original human and he became the Tin Woodman.

Note that the Tin Woodman will never tell you this story himself, for he has no heart and seeks only revenge: revenge upon the witch who cursed him, upon the tinsmith who did not replace his heart, upon the rain that rusts him. Someday, he will find all the original parts of himself, no matter who they belong to currently, so that he can return to his original form.

- **Motive:** Revenge, find his original body parts
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere
    
- **Health:** 21
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Armor:** 4
    
- **Movement:** Short; immediate if rusted
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to rust
    
- **Combat:** Inflicts 7 points of damage with his enchanted axe.
    

Enchanted axe (artifact)

 

level 7; inflicts 7 points of damage; can be activated to move a long distance away from the wielder and attack a foe as an action. Depletion: 1 in 1d20 (check each activation)

- **Interaction:** The Tin Woodman is singularly focused, and cares only about clues that lead to revenge or his original body parts. He does not eat, drink, or sleep, and often comes across as frantic and frenzied.
    
- **Use:** The PCs are hunting the same foe that the Tin Woodman is, and either they join together, or the Tin Woodman tries to prevent them from reaching the foe before he does.
    
- **Loot:** Enchanted axe
    

**GM Intrusion:** A character's weapon gets caught in the Tin Woodman's metal body, pulling the weapon out of their hands.

### TROLL6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 129)

A troll is a hideous humanoid standing at least 10 feet (3 m) tall that hunts more by smell than by sight. They are dangerous but not particularly intelligent. Always ravenous, trolls eat anything, and rarely take the time to cook a meal. Usually, they distend their mouths and throats and swallow subdued prey whole.

- **Motive:** Hungers for flesh
    
- **Environment:** Nearly anywhere, hunting alone or in pairs
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 7 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Long
    
- **Modifications:** Speed defense as level 5 due to size; Might defense as level 7; sees through deception as level 4
    
- **Combat:** The troll attacks with its claws. If it hits, it grabs a foe tightly, then squeezes and bites until the victim is dead or it releases that victim to attack another creature. Each round that a held creature does not escape, they take 10 points of damage.
    
    Trolls regain 3 points of health per round. If a troll suffers a particularly egregious wound (10 or more points of damage in one round), rather than regain health in that round (and instead of taking any other action), the troll divides into two level 4 trolls that are 3 feet (1 m) tall. Spawned trolls that survive the battle and have access to food grow into full-power trolls within a few weeks.
    
- **Interaction:** Trolls speak their own simple language, but a few know a little bit of a local human language. Most prefer to attack and eat other creatures, but might be bargained with after a successful show of force.
    

Spawned troll

 

level 4; Might defense as level 5; health 15; Armor 1; claws inflict 5 points of damage; grabbed victim suffers 5 points of damage each round held by troll

- **Use:** Trolls may be chance encounters in the wilderness for unlucky travelers. Sometimes captured trolls are used by slavers, armies, and powerful wizards as guards and warriors.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The struck troll divides into two separate trolls that immediately attack the character in the same action.

### WITCH5 (15)+

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 368)(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 132)

Witches are complex beings of myriad personalities, desires, and abilities. Sometimes they're the stuff of nightmares, with tales of their exploits keeping children safe in their beds during the darkest hours. Other times they're wise helpers—at least for a little while, or possibly for a price. Often, they're a little of everything, taking on no end of roles throughout their lifetime. They may isolate themselves deep in the dark woods, falsify their way into a royal family, or reside in the middle of town, hiding their identity. Some witches have magical abilities that rival those of an enchanter.

But one thing they are, always, is dangerous, for they carry within their hearts and heads knowledge, power, and magic—and a willingness to use all of them when necessary.

**Editor's Notes —** This NPC listing combines two identically named creatures from the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/) and [We Are All Mad Here](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/we-are-all-mad-here/).

- **Motive:** Domination of others, power, knowledge, eternal life or beauty, hunger, revenge
    
- **Environment:** Almost anywhere, although most often alone in unique dwellings in the forest, in civilization as healers, or having infiltrated royal families.
    
- **Health:** 21
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Movement:** Short; long if flying
    
- **Combat:** In addition to inflicting damage with their weapon of choice (often a staff or long, curved blade). They also have a number of curses, spells, and abilities at their disposal, including the following:
    
    - _Charm:_ Victims within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll are enslaved. Victims turn on their allies or take some other action described by their new master. The curse lasts for one minute, or until the victims succeed on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail a roll, the next roll is hindered by one additional step.
    - _Familiar:_ When attacked, a witch relies on the aid of their familiar to improve their Speed defense. The familiar could be a large black cat, an owl, a big snake, or some other creature. Killing a witch's familiar is so shocking to a witch that their attacks and Speed defense are hindered for a few days. It's also a way to ensure that the witch never forgives their foe or grants mercy.
    - _Glamour:_ Glamour is an illusion that the witch creates. It may let them look like someone else, appear to be a tree or a bird, or even make them invisible. Seeing through the glamour is a level 8 Intellect task. A failed attempt inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Once a character sees through the glamour, they cannot unsee it.
    - _Heal:_ The witch touches another creature and heals them for 6 points of damage. Some witches must pull health from another living being in long range in order to use this ability. Pulling health from a living being inflicts 2 points of damage on that being.
    - _Hexbolt:_ A victim within long range is attacked with fire, cold, or psychic bolts, as the witch chooses. Psychic bolts deal 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).
    - _Imprison:_ The witch creates a prison within long range and captures a foe inside it as a single action. The prison might be physical (a tower, a cage, a trap, a binding around the body) or mental (they can't move, their muscles are no longer under their control, they are afraid to move). Resisting being caught is a level 5 defense task (Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the type of imprisonment). If a character is caught, breaking free is a level 5 task (of the appropriate stat).
    - _Protect:_ Places a confinement spell to keep someone from going in or out of a location, building, or room. Those who attempt to pass through the spell but fail take 3 points of Intellect damage and are knocked back. Once the spell activates, it disappears.
    - _Revive:_ This rare and costly ability allows a witch to bring someone back to life, as long as they haven't been dead for more than a year. In order to accomplish this, the witch needs all or part of the body of the dead, a beloved object of the dead's, and the willingness of someone else to take on a curse that results from the magical working (roll on the Curse table to determine the resulting curse). Revive takes ten minutes to cast, and the character returns to life with 1 point in all of their Pools.
    - _Seduce:_ Creatures within short range who fail an Intellect defense roll become enamored of the witch. Resisting the witch's persuasion attempts is hindered by two steps until the victim succeeds on an Intellect defense roll; each time they fail to resist the persuasion attempt, the witch's next persuasion attempt is eased by an additional step.
    - _Shrivel:_ A victim within long range and up to two creatures next to the victim must succeed on a Might defense roll or take 3 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor). In each subsequent round, a victim who failed the previous roll must make another Might defense roll with the same outcome on failure.
    - _Vitality:_ The witch regains 11 points of health and gains +3 to Armor for one minute. Multiple uses don't further improve Armor.

Familiar

 

level 3; health 9; Armor 1

Witches thrive on unpredictability, and rarely cast the same curse or spell more than once every other round.

- **Interaction:** Most witches are deceptive and conniving, though a few work against the stereotype. All witches are willing to negotiate, though the devious ones usually do so in bad faith.
    
- **Use:** The PCs need an old book to continue their investigation. Word is that the old woman who lives on the edge of the woods has the only copy.
    
- **Loot:** A witch usually has an artifact or two on their person, possibly including a flying broom (which has a depletion roll of 1 in 1d10).
    

**GM Intrusions:** After a character succeeds on a defense roll against one of the witch's ongoing curse effects, the witch immediately tosses a hexbolt at them. If the character is hit, the ongoing curse effect also continues.

The witch's familiar joins the fray, tripping up characters and hindering their actions.

Something startles the witch and they cast a curse or spell as an automatic response. The witch pulls out an artifact or cypher and prepares to use it.

#### WITCHES BY LEVEL

- 5The Blind Witch (WAAMH, 134)
- 5Dame Gothel (WAAMH, 134)
- 5The Wicked Witch of the West (WAAMH, 135)
- 6The Sea Witch (WAAMH, 135)
- 9Baba Yaga (WAAMH, 133)

#### BABA YAGA9 (27)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 133)

Baba Yaga (sometimes called Frau Trude) lives many lives and has many personalities. She is both one witch and many. She uses her magic to create a new version of herself each time her life takes a new branch, following all of them at once, becoming every version of herself that she might have been.

Some versions of Baba Yaga are helpful. Others harmful. Some Baba Yagas live in the woods in a wooden hut that walks around on giant chicken legs, some fly through the sky in a giant mortar and pestle, and some guard any wild spaces that they have deemed important. Some capture and cook young children in a special stove. Some do all of the above.

- **Combat:** Baba Yaga can use the following abilities: _heal_, _hexbolt_, _imprison_, _protect_, _revive_, _shrivel_, and _vitality_.
    
- **Interaction:** It is almost impossible to know which Baba Yaga you have met until you look deep in her eyes (a level 7 Intellect task). There, you might see a tiny flame, and in that flame, learn a bit about her life.
    
- **Use:** Baba Yaga has her long, bony fingers in nearly everything that happens. She might be behind the counter at the herb and potion shop, guarding the entrance to a cave full of treasure, or offering her services in breaking (or casting) curses.
    
- **Loot:** 1d6 cyphers, an artifact, and various other odds and ends
    

#### THE BLIND WITCH5 (15)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 133)

The Blind Witch is skinny and always hungry. She lives deep in the forest in a house made of confectionery, which allows her to catch, fatten, and eventually eat any children unlucky enough to get caught in her trap.

- **Modifications:** Cooking as level 6, deception and trickery as level 7, seeing through deception and trickery as level 4
    
- **Combat:** She can use the following abilities: _charm_, _protect_, and _vitality_. She is immune to visual effects, including hallucinations.
    
- **Interaction:** The Blind Witch can appear sweet and charming, and might play up her blindness and apparent frailty for sympathy.
    
- **Use:** Characters wandering the woods might come upon a candy house, and woe to them should they take a bite. A rescue mission could lead here.
    
- **Loot:** She usually has at least one magical animal in a cage, along with various children and even adults. Two or three cyphers can be found in her kitchen, along with her magic oven, which bakes children into gingerbread.
    

#### DAME GOTHEL5 (15)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 133)

Sometimes taking the form of a young woman and sometimes an old one, Dame Gothel cares for one thing above all: her beautiful walled garden, the flowers and vegetables that grow inside it being the envy of all others. Unlike many other witches, she does not harm children and in fact has been known to protect them, at least as long as they are innocent of wrongdoing.

- **Modifications:** Gardening and potions as level 6
    
- **Combat:** She can use the following abilities: _heal_, _imprison_, _protect_, and _shrivel_.
    
- **Interaction:** Dame Gothel is an introvert who mostly desires to be left alone, and woe be to those who invade her space in any way, for she has a deep sense of right and wrong and a penchant for revenge upon those who cross her. However, she has been known to help those seeking aid, and is particularly skilled in using what she grows in her garden to aid her magic.
    
- **Use:** The characters need a concoction to heal someone, remove a curse, or help them get pregnant. The characters accidentally trespass on Dame Gothel's space.
    
- **Loot:** Various plants, potions, and cyphers
    

#### THE SEA WITCH6 (18)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 135)

Living in the darkest depths of the sea, the Sea Witch is dangerous, wily, persuasive, and scheming. She is best known for brewing up life options—for a price. If you want what she's got (and she's got everything), you bring her what she wants. It might be your voice, your hair, or your firstborn. Or all three. Surely you won't miss them …

- **Modifications:** Persuasion, intimidation, coercion, and swimming as level 8
    
- **Combat:** She can use the following abilities: _charm_, _familiar_ (water snakes), _glamour_, _imprison_, _protect_, _seduce_, and _shrivel_.
    
- **Interaction:** The Sea Witch will always make a bargain, take a bet, gamble all she's got on the downtrodden and woe-be-gotten. Not because her heart is big, but because she makes sure that the house—that's her—always wins.
    
- **Use:** The characters need a potion, a spell, a curse, or any other bit of magic, large or small, and the Sea Witch will find a way to put it in their hands and let them walk away thinking they've come out ahead. At least until she comes to collect.
    
- **Loot:** A chest full of gifts and winnings from lovers, fawners, and those who should have known better, including 1d6 cyphers and two artifacts.
    

#### THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST5 (15)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 135)

With her three pigtails and diminutive stature, it would be easy to write off the Wicked Witch of the West as a nobody—and many have—but her power lies in the creatures that work for her and in her vast and growing collection of magical footwear.

She can see up to 2 miles (3 km) away with her single eye, and wears galoshes that give her +2 Armor against water and liquid of all kinds.

- **Modifications:** Tasks involving water and the dark as level 3
    
- **Combat:** She carries an umbrella that acts as a heavy weapon, and she can use the following abilities: _familiar_ (pack of wolves, swarm of bees, flock of crows, and an army of flying monkeys), _hexbolt_, _imprison_, _protect_, and _shrivel_.
    
- **Interaction:** She is volatile in nature and quick to anger. However, she can also be a bit cowardly, and will likely back down in a confrontation (only to send her hordes of magical animals out afterward to do her dirty work).
    
- **Use:** The characters need to find galoshes of fortune and decide to steal a pair from the Wicked Witch of the West. Perhaps they need to make it through the land she presides over and must find a way to get her approval.
    
- **Loot:** Whatever shoes she's wearing (which are very likely an artifact).
    

### WIZARD, MIGHTY8 (24)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 376)

Some wizards learn so many spells and accumulate so much lore that they become incredibly powerful. Some work for a higher purpose, whereas others are concerned only with themselves.

- **Motive:** Seek powerful sources of magic (to collect or to keep safe)
    
- **Health:** 40
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
    
- **Movement:** Short
    
- **Modifications:** All tasks related to knowledge of arcane lore as level 9
    
- **Combat:** When a wizard makes a long-range attack with their staff or strikes someone with it, arcane energy damages the target and, if desired, all creatures the wizard selects within short range of the target. Targets that are within immediate range of the wizard when they take damage are thrown out of immediate range.
    
    A mighty wizard knows many spells, including spells that grant +5 to Armor for an hour, spells of teleportation, spells of finding, and so on. A wizard also likely carries several cyphers useful in combat.
    
- **Interaction:** Care should be taken when negotiating with wizards because they are subtle and quick to anger. Even when negotiations succeed, a wizard's suggestions are usually cryptic and open to interpretation. A mighty wizard might be convinced to teach a character how to cast a spell.
    
- **Use:** A wizard is putting together a team to challenge a great foe, and the PCs fit the bill.
    
- **Loot:** A mighty wizard has 1d6 cyphers.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The wizard casts two spells as a single action instead of just one.

### WOLF, BIG BAD8 (24)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 111)

The Big Bad Wolf (just call him the Wolf, for he is truly the only one worthy of that title) is a beast of near immortality, kept alive by the legends that swirl around him, the constant stream of terrorizing tales. Once the stalker of the woods, now he stalks the streets and towns, no longer staying to the shadows, no longer merely hunting girls and grandmothers. As his reputation has grown, so has his appetite. He hungers. He swallows worlds. He will not be contained.

- **Motive:** Hunger
    
- **Environment:** Woods, cities, behind you
    
- **Health:** 30
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 8 points
    
- **Armor:** 1
    
- **Movement:** Long
    
- **Modifications:** Hunting, seeking, and sneaking as level 9
    
- **Combat:** The Wolf 's bite does 8 points of damage. Additionally, he has a variety of abilities that he may use.
    
    - _What Big Ears You Have:_ Can track and hear his prey up to a mile away. Tracking ignores all cloaking abilities, including magical ones.
    - _What Big Eyes You Have:_ Mesmerizes his victims for two rounds, convincing them that he is a friend and that they should do what he suggests.
    - _What Big Teeth You Have:_ Swallows his victim whole, holding them in his belly. It's a level 8 Speed or Might defense task to avoid being eaten whole. Captured characters can attempt to cut themselves free, which requires three successful attacks.
    - _Huff and Puff:_ Exhale creates a wind so strong it can knock over foes, trees, and even houses. Inflicts 6 points of damage to everything within long distance, and knocks most things prone. Once the Wolf uses this ability, he can't use it again for three rounds.
- **Interaction:** Despite his constant hunger and his gnawing need to swallow the world, the Wolf makes an interesting ally (provided that he's well fed at the time) for he is smart and cunning, and has myriad tricks for moving through the world.
    
- **Use:** The Big Bad Wolf is a great character to introduce into a modern fairy tale game. Imagine his new iteration as an urban legend, spreading through the internet.
    

**GM Intrusions:** The Wolf makes a great leap, knocking down foes. The Wolf already has someone swallowed in his belly, and that person calls for help from out of the Wolf's mouth.

### WRAITH (HOMO VACUUS)4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 141)

Wraiths (Homo vacuus) are genetically engineered to live in the vacuum of space by directly metabolizing high-energy charged particles abundant in the void. Though derived from human stock, wraiths are alien in body, sometimes concealing themselves in layers of shroud-like tissue, other times revealing themselves as wispy, elongated things of glowing red plasma. In some settings, wraiths are partners with humans, working in locations where humans would find difficult. In other settings, wraiths went their own way generations earlier, and rediscovering them would be a first contact scenario. Alternatively, wraiths might be a threat to humans, hating humans for having created a species forced to spend its existence in the dark void of space.

- **Motive:** Varies with individual or setting
    
- **Environment:** Anywhere in vacuum, though usually with access to some kind of enriched radiation source. Environments with 1 G or higher eventually kill wraiths.
    
- **Health:** 15
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Movement:** Short when flying in zero and low G
    
- **Modifications:** Perception and stealth tasks as level 7
    
- **Combat:** Wraiths can unfold from their concealing shrouds and attack with radioactive limbs for 6 points of Speed damage from ionizing radiation (ignores most Armor), or if available, technological weapons. Some can direct ionizing radiation as long-distance attacks, though doing so costs the wraith 1 point of health. Wraiths are immune to radiation, and attacks using radiation heal a wraith's lost health by the amount of damage the attack would have otherwise afflicted. Gravity of 1 G or greater hinders all wraith actions.
    
- **Interaction:** Wraiths communicate by radio. They react to outsiders as dictated by their place in the setting.
    
- **Use:** A distant space station stops all communication. Investigators are dispatched to find out what happened. Once aboard, they unravel clues that suggest wraiths may have been responsible.
    
- **Loot:** Some wraiths carry valuable items and equipment.
    

**GM Intrusion:** The attacked character must also succeed on a Might defense, or they take an additional 3 points of ambient damage and contract radiation sickness.
