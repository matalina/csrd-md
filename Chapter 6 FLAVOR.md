- Combat (36)

- or Additional Flavors (OG-CSRD)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 34)

Flavors are groups of special abilities the GM and players can use to alter a character type to make it more to their liking or more appropriate to the genre or setting. For example, if a player wants to create a magic-using thief character, she could play an Adept with stealth flavoring. In a science fiction setting, a Warrior might also have knowledge of machinery, so the character could be flavored with technology.

At a given tier, abilities from a flavor are traded one for one with standard abilities from a type. So to add the Danger Sense stealth flavor ability to a Warrior, something else—perhaps Bash—must be sacrificed. Now that character can choose Danger Sense as they would any other first-tier warrior ability, but they can never choose Bash.

The GM should always be involved in flavoring a type. For example, they might know that for their science fiction game, they want a type called a "Glam," which is a Speaker flavored with certain technology abilities—specifically those that make the character a flamboyant starship pilot. Thus, they exchange the first-tier abilities Spin Identity and Inspire Aggression for the technology flavor abilities Datajack and Tech Skills so the character can plug into the ship directly and can take piloting and computers as skills.

In the end, flavor is mostly a tool for the GM to easily create campaign-specific types by making a few slight alterations to the four base types. Although players may wish to use flavors to get the characters they want, remember that they can also shape their PCs with descriptors and foci very nicely.

The flavors available are stealth, technology, magic, combat, and skills and knowledge.

The full description for each listed ability can be found in Chapter 9: : Abilities, which also contains descriptions for type and focus abilities in a single vast catalog.

## HOUSE RULE: SIMPLIFIED FLAVOR

_The section has been added by the editor._

---

Using this rule, flavor abilities are added to a PC's list of type abilities—but no sacrifices from the list are made. Since this rule makes flavor purely additive, it's probably a good idea if every PC has the option to choose a flavor at the start of the game, or earn one in the game, for example, by completing a character arc.

---

## HOUSE RULE: PERSONALIZED FLAVOR

_The section is based on _Using Character Types to Define the Setting_ (415), paraphrased by the editor._

---

Using this rule, the GM allows personalized flavors for PCs. It can be a good idea to choose a new name for the PC's When using this option, it's a good the PC's type a new name that reflects their individual, group, or societal role in the setting, and choose any optional character advancements they might have available to them.

- **Gaining a Flavor:** The GM might allow PCs to earn a flavor by completing a character arc like Join an Organization, Master a Skill, Mysterious Background, Transformation, or Uncover a Secret, or purchase a flavor by spending 4 XP as a long-term benefit or character advancement.
    
- **Adding Flavor Abilities:** When a PC gains a flavor or advance to a new tier, that player and the GM should work together to create a list of special abilities appropriate for the PC's tier. If the PC gained their flavor at a after reaching second-tier, the GM should allow them to make a few additional exchanges of type abilities.
    
- **Approving Flavor Abilities:** The GM approves each ability to determine it is of appropriate tier, it is appropriate to the game setting, and—most importantly—won't make another PC feel redundant, or be disruptive in the game.

## STEALTH FLAVOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 34)

Characters with the stealth flavor are good at sneaking around, infiltrating places they don't belong, and deceiving others. They use these abilities in a variety of ways, including combat. An Explorer with stealth flavor might be a thief, while a Warrior with stealth flavor might be an assassin. An Explorer with stealth flavor in a superhero setting might be a crimefighter who stalks the streets at night. (34)

## TECHNOLOGY FLAVOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 35)

Characters with a flavor of technology typically are from science fiction or at least modern-day settings (although anything is possible). They excel at using, dealing with, and building machines. An Explorer with technology flavor might be a starship pilot, and a Speaker flavored with technology could be a techno-priest.

Some of the less computer-oriented abilities might be appropriate for a steampunk character, while a modern-day character could use some of the abilities that don't involve starships or ultratech. (35)

## MAGIC FLAVOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 36)

You know a little about magic. You might not be a wizard, but you know the basics—how it works, and how to accomplish a few wondrous things. Of course, in your setting, "magic" might actually mean psychic powers, mutant abilities, weird alien tech, or anything else that produces interesting and useful effects.

An Explorer flavored with magic might be a wizard-hunter, and a Speaker with magical flavor might be a sorcerer-bard. Although an Adept flavored with magic is still an Adept, you might find that swapping some of the type's basic abilities with those given here tailors the character in desirable ways. (34)

## SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FLAVOR

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 37)

This flavor is for characters in roles that call for more knowledge and more real-world application of talent. It's less flashy and dramatic than supernatural powers or the ability to hack apart multiple foes, but sometimes expertise or know-how is the real solution to a problem.
