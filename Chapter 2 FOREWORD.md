# Chapter 2: FOREWORD

This hypertext version of the February 26, 2024 [Cypher System Reference Document (CSRD)](http://csol.montecookgames.com/) aligns that content to the chapter structure of the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/). It is intended to be a reference tool to help Game Masters (GMs) and players to have little trouble "getting on the same page" even if they are reading from different sources. Minimal typographical edits have been made to improve organization, presentation, and consistency across the CSRD's vast wealth of "toys".

If you're just getting started with the Cypher System, the official [Cypher System Reference Rules Primer](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rules-primer/) is a great place to start before you continue reading further.

The CSRD also includes material published in the following books, and page number references for each have been added throughout as follows:

Rather than create new sections, this edition of the CSRD integrates as much as possible into the existing chapter structure. For example, content drawn from [Claim the Sky](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/claim-the-sky/) appears primarily in Chapter 18: : Superheroes.

While this document provides everything you need short of a few dice, the CSRD doesn't include everything in the informing material—far from it. In addition to spectacular artwork and the seductive odor of book glue, each product includes additional useful rules, helpful guidance, as well as setting information and adventure modules that still makes them well worth a purchase.

## EDITORIAL ADDITIONS

The index provide a navigable overview of the OG-CSRD, including lists of Quick References (which align headers to the page numbers of informing CSRD material), Optional Rules, Editorial Additions, and What's In the Book?—a guide to products you can purchase to further supplement your adventures in the Cypher System.

**Editor's Notes —** These unofficial annotations draw upon years of community experience running the Cypher System, providing misprint corrections, GM considerations, and cross-references. Don't mistake anything in the editor's notes for "the rules", though—play it your way!
