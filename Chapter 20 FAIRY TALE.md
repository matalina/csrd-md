(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 302)

The genre of fairy tales is a wide one, crossing into almost every culture and encompassing everything from early oral stories passed down from generation to generation to the more modern literary fairy tale. What makes something a fairy tale? While there's a great deal of discussion around that question, most have a number of things in common: a series of far-fetched events; fantastical beings such as talking animals, elves, goblins, mermaids, witches, and dragons; and objects that have magical elements.

One of the powers of a fairy tale—or a game set in a fairy tale-inspired setting—is its ability to create a sense of wonder and to evoke players' imaginations while still allowing them to keep one foot in the known. The very settings themselves are both enchanted and somehow familiar, whether the characters are entering a magical woods, falling down a rabbit hole, or embarking on a voyage to Neverland. Those beasts and beings who stalk such places are equally wondrous, and offer fantastic starting points for any number of adventures.

To heighten the sense of wonder in a fairy tale adventure or campaign, a GM might consider presenting the game in a modern setting. In a modern setting, characters have regular jobs that don't normally involve hunting goblins or helping talking fish solve puzzles. This means that when the moths take shape and become the cloak of a princess of summer come to beg a favor or steal a child, or the house grows legs and runs away one morning, the player characters will be rightfully amazed (and perhaps somewhat terrified).

## NATURE OF FAERIE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 303)

Faerie (also called by many other names) is a dimension of magic separate from but closely parallel to the mundane world. It doesn't matter whether Faerie is just a collective term for thousands of separate curled-up dimensions hidden in corners, in closets, or at the center of forests, or it's one continuous realm that overlaps the real world where it's thinnest. It's a place those with open hearts can find by following a way between tall trees (or looming library shelves) to a realm where everything is different. Where elves walk, nymphs dance, unicorns gallop, and both natural growths and built structures become vast and enchanting.

Humans don't tend to do well in such a world if they stay too long, as the sensory input is hard on the nervous system. But fey creatures depend on it, like plants to the light. A fey creature too long cut off from its land of origin (or its stream, hill, or burrow) slowly becomes mortal and then dies.

When a fey creature is cut by silvered or cold iron weapons, they temporarily lose the sustaining benefit of their connection to Faerie. This severed connection usually disrupts a fey creature's ability to heal. A silvered weapon is one that contains silver as part of an alloying process, has silver inlay, or has been coated in a dusting of silver powder (which usually lasts only through a single fight). In truth, many items in the modern era are cold-forged, while many others are not. We suggest that any hand-forged item containing iron could be considered a cold-forged weapon for harming fey creatures. Thus, most bullets and other modern items wouldn't be treated as cold iron by this definition, but some would fit the bill.

In a fairy tale game, the PCs might consist of a talking fox, an ogre, a fairy, and a human the size of your thumb. And that's perfectly fine. Build your character sentence in a way that plays to your character's strengths and weaknesses, and the rest can be handled through story and narrative. Playing a talking bear, a gingerbread man, or a changeling will likely affect your character's appearance, their outlook on life, and their backstory, but it doesn't necessarily affect their abilities, skills, and Pools beyond what you choose during character creation.

Because the form that you choose doesn't typically offer you something in addition to your Cypher System stats—being small, for example, does not inherently mean you're stealthy—you'll want to choose your stats to emphasize the bit of your character that you want to play.

### ADJUSTED FOCI

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 67)

Suggested Types for a Fairy Tale Game

|Focus|Type and Flavor|
|---|---|
|- Battles Robots<br>- Builds Robots<br>- Talks to Machines|Best for settings that include elements of science fiction. Alternatively, "robots" can be a stand-in for puppets, steampunk entities, golems, or other creations such as Pinocchio, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man. Mister Geppetto would likely be someone who Builds Robots, while Muska (from Miyazaki's film _Laputa: Castle in the Sky_) might be someone who Battles Robots.|
|- Drives Like a Maniac|Best for modern settings or those where traditional fairy tale vehicles such as horse-drawn carriages, magic carpets, witch's brooms, and chicken-legged huts are common.|
|- Fuses Flesh and Steel<br>- Fuses Mind and Machine|Best for steampunk or weird science mashups. Edward Scissorhands and the Tin Man are probably characters who Fuse Flesh and Steel. Alternatively, renaming the foci to Fuses Flesh and Magic or Wants to Become a Real Boy can provide characters with the same benefits from a more magical-sounding source.|
|- Is Licensed to Carry|With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who wants to wield a wand, bow, or other ranged weapon|
|- Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger|With small tweaks to the language and abilities, this could work for someone who used to be a sailor or pirate.|

### FAIRY TALE PLAYER INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 58)

- **Once Upon a Time:** Someone you played with as a child reappears and helps you in whatever you are doing. They may be alive or dead, but your heart is warmed upon seeing them, for it's been a long time.
    
- **As You Wish:** You do something that reminds another person or creature in the area of someone they once cared for deeply. They are eager to assist you in whatever you've got going on, at least for a few minutes.
    
- **Once Upon a Dream:** Not long ago, you dreamt of a scenario similar to the one that you find yourself in now. You can't remember all of the details, but you remember enough to know some of what's about to take place, and it gives you an additional action to prepare something useful.
    
- **Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo:** A little sprinkle of magic from your fairy godmother is all you need to achieve a goal, retry a task, or be better at something you're attempting to do.
    
- **Wish Upon a Star:** Long ago, you helped part of a dying star return to its rightful place in the sky. It keeps an eye on you and, in a moment when it feels like all hope is lost, it sends a little magic or light to aid you.
    
- **Dreams Do Come True:** Something you wished for long ago comes true just at this moment. It might be for a broken weapon to be fixed, an ally to appear, or a bit of knowledge or understanding to arrive in your mind.
    
- **What's Come to Pass:** Not long ago, someone forewarned you of the exact scenario that you find yourself in now. You know just what to do to put yourself at an advantage in the situation.
    
- **Think Happy Thoughts:** You think of something or someone that brings you great joy, and it imbues your next few actions with magic, allowing you to fly or do some other thing that you are normally unable to do.
    
- **I Can Show You the World:** Something or someone in the area shows itself to you, highlighting a route you were looking for, an object you had lost, or an answer to a problem.
    
- **Happily Ever After:** Through the power of your love for another, you use magic to protect someone you care for. They are able to sidestep an attack that would normally do them grave damage.
    

#### MINOR EFFECT SUGGESTIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 59)

- A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a bit more damage to a foe.
- A fluctuation in magic hinders all of the foe's tasks for one minute.
- A curse, spell, or ability has additional force behind it, and lasts a round longer than expected.
- The foe's magical armor begins to dissipate, decreasing the amount of protection it offers on the next attack.
- A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability dazzles the target, easing all tasks related to it.
- A magical attack hits the target and something they were holding, causing damage to both.

#### MAJOR EFFECT SUGGESTIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 59)

- A weapon comes alive at the perfect moment and does a lot more damage to a foe.
- A fluctuation in magic prevents a foe from taking their next action.
- A curse that was cast upon you by the foe you're attacking is removed.
- A foe surrenders, agreeing to lay down their weapons.
- A foe accidentally steps on a living plant or dangerous creature while trying to dodge your blow, and it attacks them or holds them fast.
- A shapeshifting or disguise spell or ability works so well that the foe's familiar or companion runs off, afraid to continue the fight.

### FAIRY TALE CHARACTER ARCS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 67)

Character arcs are fantastic opportunities for players to deepen their roleplaying options, add to the narrative, and set goals that can intertwine with and strengthen a campaign or adventure. While character arcs aren't a requirement, they work particularly well in fairy tale games, where individual goals and tasks are often at the forefront of what drives adventures.

## FAIRY TALE EQUIPMENT

### QUICK REFERENCE: FAIRY TALE EQUIPMENT

- Currency (WAAMH, 69)
- Signature Items (WAAMH, 70)
- I Have That! (WAAMH, 70)
- Basic Equipment (WAAMH, 71)
- Clothing (WAAMH, 71)
- Weapons and Armor (WAAMH, 71)
- Travel (WAAMH, 72)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 69)

Most weapons that are powered by magic, such as wands, operate exactly like a regular weapon; they just do their damage using magic.

Equipment and weapons with unique magic abilities are typically considered to be cyphers or Artifacts.

### CURRENCY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 69)

In most fairy tales, money isn't precise. Someone might be poor or rich. They might find a bag of gold or a chest full of jewels. They might be the richest man in the town or have nothing but a tired old cow to their name. But typically what they don't have is "one gold piece" or "thirty farthings" to their name. This means that whatever your fairy tale setting, you can think in general terms of money instead of keeping meticulous track of every penny, farthing, gold coin, or dollar. To keep things easy, no matter what currency your characters use, think of money as being in simple amounts that scale up, such as a copper coin, a silver coin, and a gold coin. These could easily equate to the inexpensive, moderate, and expensive items on the equipment list. Items that are very expensive might be worth a bag of silver, while exorbitant items might be worth a bag of gold.

Additionally, if the PCs are completing a character arc, accomplishing a task, or doing some other type of action to receive a piece of equipment, you can use the price category to decide how complicated or difficult that task is. A moderately priced item likely requires completing a moderately difficult task, while an exorbitant item may require something that taxes the PCs and really puts their skills and dedication to the test.

### SIGNATURE ITEMS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 70)

In fairy tales, clothing, weapons, and other items that a character carries for a long time tend to be very personal and very important. They're often unique and handcrafted, they may have names or stories that go with them, and because characters tend to keep them for a long time, they may have undergone repairs or have markings that tell something about the character's background.

---

### OPTIONAL RULE: I HAVE THAT!

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 70)

In fairy tales, characters often have exactly the right mundane piece of equipment that they need to bypass a story-related obstacle hidden away in a pocket or a bag. Rather than having the PCs stock up on mundane items like marbles, rope, and breadcrumbs in town, use the _I Have That!_ rule. This means players don't have to keep exact track of their characters' mundane equipment; instead, they spend an amount to get an unspecified "Pocket Item" in that category. Then, when they're out in the world and realize they could solve a problem with an item, they can just say, "I have that!" and pull it from their pocket. All Pocket Items are one-use only; after using them, the PC marks off one of their Pocket Items for the appropriate price category.

Most Pocket Items are inexpensive, but moderate and expensive Pocket Items exist, and are likely more useful than their less expensive counterparts.

The GM has veto power over items that they don't think you could have found or carried.

#### EXAMPLE POCKET ITEMS — INEXPENSIVE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 71)

- Apple
- Ashes (handful)
- Breadcrumbs
- Butter
- Candy
- Chalk
- Cricket in a cage
- Cup
- Egg
- Fabric
- Flyswatter
- Glass jar
- Glue
- Honey
- Leather
- Magnets
- Marbles
- Nails
- Needle and thread
- Paper
- Plait of hair
- Pot of fat
- Pot of grease
- Ribbon
- Rice (handful)
- Straw
- Tacks
- Wax
- Wool

#### EXAMPLE POCKET ITEMS — MODERATELY-PRICED

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 71)

- Bird in a cage
- Sewing shears
- Thimble

### BASIC EQUIPMENT

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 71)

Basic Equipment

|Price|Basic Equipment|
|---|---|
|Inexpensive|- Candle<br>- Chalk (3)<br>- Day's rations<br>- Meal, decent<br>- Sack<br>- Sewing kit<br>- Sharpening stone<br>- String or yarn<br>- Thimble<br>- Tinder and flint<br>- Torch (3)<br>- Vial|
|Moderately priced|- Backpack<br>- Bedroll<br>- Book<br>- Box, small<br>- Deck of cards<br>- Game<br>- Lantern<br>- Meal, fine dining<br>- Metal file<br>- Mining pick<br>- Mirror, hand<br>- Quill, ink and paper (2 pieces)<br>- Rope (50 feet)<br>- Tent<br>- Waterskin or flask|
|Expensive|- Bag of heavy tools<br>- Bag of light tools<br>- Box, medium|
|Very Expensive|- _Charon's obol._ Imbued coin. Placed in the mouth of a dead person prior to burial as payment to Charon, the ferryman, for conveying the soul to its proper resting place.<br>- _Disguise kit/potion._ Asset for disguise tasks.<br>- _Healing kit/potion._ Asset for healing tasks.<br>- _Protective charm._ Church bell, four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot, and so on. Asset on defense rolls against fairies and other fey-like creatures.<br>- _Handheld scrying mirror._ Asset for initiative tasks when held in hand or worn.|

Using the I Have That! rule doesn't preclude PCs from also purchasing these items directly. For example, if a character who sews wants to buy a thimble and an inexpensive Pocket Item, they can. However, they cannot later turn the thimble into a Pocket Item; it remains a thimble.

### CLOTHING

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 70)(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 71)

In most cases, characters start out by wearing any type of clothing they choose. Typically (unless the GM decides otherwise or unless it is designated as armor), this clothing is purely for decorative and roleplaying purposes and offers no additional benefits.

However, clothing with additional benefits can be purchased, stolen, found, or earned by completing favors and accomplishing tasks.

Clothing

|Price|Clothing|
|---|---|
|Inexpensive|- Gloves or mittens<br>- Hat or hood|
|Moderately priced|- Cloak or coat<br>- Specialized outfit (craftsman, baker, guard, and so on)<br>- Wizard or enchanter's outfit|
|Very Expensive|- Elegant cloak or coat<br>- Royal ensemble<br>- Suit or ballgown|
|Exorbitant|- Elegant, bespoke clothing suitable for moving in elite circles (provides an asset in interaction tasks)|

### WEAPONS AND ARMOR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 71)

Weapons and Protective Gear

|Price|Weapons and Protective Gear|
|---|---|
|Inexpensive|- Ammunition (12 arrows, 12 crossbow bolts, and so on)|
|Moderately priced|- Light weapons (knives, handaxe, hairpin, darts, wand, slingshot, and so on)<br>- Light armor (hides and furs, thieves' armor, leather jerkin, padded coat, and so on)|
|Expensive|- Medium weapon (club, sword, battleaxe, mace, crossbow, spear, staff, and so on)<br>- Medium armor (breastplate, brigade, chainmail, and so on)|
|Very Expensive|- Heavy weapon (huge sword, great hammer, massive axe, halberd, heavy crossbow, and so on)<br>- Heavy armor (full plate armor)|
|Exorbitant|- Jeweled, ornate, royal, or bespoke weapon<br>- Jeweled, ornate, royal, or bespoke armor|

Remember, armor (with a lowercase a) is something that the character wears, while Armor (with a capital A) is the total amount of Armor that you have, including any magical effects. You can wear only one type of armor at any given time, but you could have many things that give you Armor.

### TRAVEL

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 72)

Travel

|Price|Travel|
|---|---|
|Moderately priced|- Common transportation, rental (horse-drawn carriage, boat, mount, and so on)<br>- Lodging, shared room or shed, meager|
|Expensive|- Magic transportation, rental (chicken-legged hut, levitating mortar, magic carpet, talking mount, flying ship, and so on). In most cases, renting magic transportation includes a guide, driver, or other person who can power and operate the vehicle. For example, a levitating mortar can only be driven by a witch of a certain age.<br>- Common transportation, purchase (horse-drawn carriage, boat, mount, and so on)<br>- Lodging, solo room, decent|
|Very Expensive|- Lodging, whole building or large room|
|Exorbitant|- Magic transportation, rental (chicken-legged hut, levitating mortar, magic carpet, talking mount, flying ship, and so on). In most cases, it's also necessary to hire a guide, driver, or other person who can control and power the vehicle. Alternatively, characters must take a class, learn a spell, or meet other magic requirements in order to operate the vehicle.|

## FAIRY TALE RULES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 48)

Fairy tale games have unique opportunities for magic that aren't found elsewhere—death, curses, blessings, and wishes are all prevalent in fairy tales and make interesting elements in games. Here are some suggested ways to handle them.

### DEATH

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 48)

You've probably noticed that in fairy tales, characters die all the time. Or almost die. Or sleep forever instead of die. Or die and come back to life. You get the idea.

Potentially, this will also be true in a fairy tale game. Thankfully, death doesn't have to be the end of a character's life. There are any number of ways to stop or reverse death, including artifacts, cyphers, and abilities. Additionally, a few NPCs, such as witches or Death themself, may have the power to bring someone back from the dead.

Typically, though, if a character dies and chooses to stay dead (or is unable to find a way to return to life), they are dead—they no longer have bodies, abilities, Pools, and so on. They can communicate to the living only through magic. Someone may stay dead for up to about a year (in game time) and still return to life. After that time elapses, death is permanent.

### CURSES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 49)

In fairy tale games, curses are likely to be common. Most witches can cast curses of one form or another, as can many fey beings, queens, and sea creatures. Even objects and places can cause a character to become cursed. Characters might have multiple curses on them at the same time.

All curses have a level, from 1 to 10. The level affects how hard it is to resist the curse, as well as how severe the effects are and how difficult it is to remove the curse.

Curses work slightly differently than regular damage. Curses can have an impact on the game and the game mechanics (a character is turned into a fish or becomes invisible, all of their interactions are hindered, they take ongoing damage, and so on), or they can have more of a roleplaying impact (a character looks much older, they forget the word "apple," their skin turns golden). See the Curse table for a list of example curses.

#### PREVENTING CURSES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 49)

When a character attempts to resist being cursed, they must make an Intellect defense roll against the level of the curse being cast. Being trained in Intellect defense eases this task, as does having a skill in curses or resisting curses.

Often, part of a curse's effects is hindering curse resistance; thus, a character who already has one curse on them will find defending against a second curse is more difficult (their task is hindered).

#### REMOVING CURSES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 49)

Similar to poison and disease, curses aren't automatically removed when a character makes a regular recovery roll. Instead, they stick around, continuing to affect the PC long after the curse is cast. In order to rid themselves of a curse, the character must take actions to remove it. The actions required depend on the nature and level of the curse.

The easiest way to remove a curse is to find, buy, steal, borrow, or otherwise acquire an object that removes curses (such as the blood pearl blossom cypher). Alternatively, the character might be able to pay someone who is skilled in curse removal to do the deed.

#### CURSE INTRUSIONS AND CURSE MODE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 50)

In addition to dealing with the original effect of the curse, a cursed character is more likely to have bad things happen to them. There are two ways for the GM to work this into the game: curse intrusions and Curse Mode. Ideally, you'll want to use both of these, as they each add something unique to the experience of being cursed.

Curse intrusions work like regular GM intrusions, and the cursed character gets XP. However, they only get 1 XP instead of the usual 2, and they must decide whether to keep it or give it to another player. Introduce additional curse intrusions from the Curse Intrusions table when it feels appropriate. This might be anytime the character has a big success, when they're in a particularly risky position, or when they start to feel like they've forgotten about the curse.

**Curse Mode.** When using this rule, the GM increases the range of numbers that trigger a GM intrusion. As soon as a character is cursed, every time they roll a 1 or a 2 (instead of just a 1), they trigger a GM intrusion. As time passes, GM intrusions happen on a roll of 1 to 3, then a roll of 1 to 4, and so on. This potentially means that a die roll in Curse Mode can indicate success i a task and still trigger a GM intrusion. Curse Mode is similar to Horror Mode optional rule in the Chapter 16: : Horror, with one exception: the escalation works at a much slower pace. This is because Curse Mode is not designed to heighten immediate tension, but rather to create a long-term sense of being saddled with an unwanted and unpredictable negative effect.

Typically, the intrusion range is increased by 1 when:

- The character is cursed.
- The character starts a new day (or makes their ten-hour recovery roll).
- The character actively takes an action to remove the curse (curses like wreaking havoc, which is part of the reason they're so hard to get rid of).
- The character attempts to resist an additional curse being cast upon them.

Once all curses are removed, Curse Mode is no longer in effect.

While not all regular GM intrusions are necessarily bad for the character, curse intrusions always make the cursed PC's situation worse.

#### CURSE INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 50)

Curse Intrusions

|d6|Curse|
|---|---|
|1|An insect stings or bites the character at just the wrong moment.|
|2|Something in the area makes the character sneeze loudly and repeatedly.|
|3|The character shimmers in and out of view.|
|4|A deep sense of despair comes over the character.|
|5|The character feels an overwhelming urge to start dancing.|
|6|The character's clothes are suddenly much too large.|

#### CURSE TABLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 51)

Roll on the Curse table to determine the effect of the curse, or choose one that feels appropriate to the situation and the characters.

Typically, curses that have simple roleplaying effects (such as the character's inability to speak their own name) are lower-level curses, while those that affect gameplay (such as decreasing recovery roll points) are higher level. Curses that have multiple effects are likely the highest level of all. However, sometimes an incredibly simple curse is still very high level because the caster wants to make it very hard to get rid of.

Curse Table

|---|---|
|1|Turned into an animal (bear, toad, hedgehog, swan, dog, _etc._)|
|2|Becomes invisible|
|3|Turned into a living object|
|4|Turned into a great beast|
|5|Turned into someone much older|
|6|Forced to dance all night|
|7|When speaking, bugs and toads fall from mouth|
|8|Enchanted sleep|
|9|Forced to wear iron shoes (hinders all Speed actions)|
|10|Turned into a flower|
|11|Voice taken away|

|17|Brain is in a fog (Effort on Intellect tasks costs +1 Intellect)|
|18|Moves slowly (effort on Speed tasks costs +1 Speed)|
|19|Can no longer say, write, or spell their own name|
|20|No one else remembers or recognizes the character|

#### CURSE REMOVAL TABLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 52)

Some curses have a specific way that they must be removed. Others can be removed in a variety of ways. You can use the table as a reference for ways to remove or undo a curse, or you can roll 1d10 to give a curse a specific method of removal.

There are also many artifacts, cyphers, and other objects in the world that will remove (or prevent) curses.

Curse Removal Table

|d10|Removal Process|
|---|---|
|1|Complete an important task for the one who cursed you.|
|2|Complete an important task for (or make a large payment to) someone who promises to remove your curse.|
|3|Make things right (return the stolen item, apologize, or undo whatever was done to cause the curse to happen in the first place).|
|4|Write the name of the curse on a scrap of paper, bind it in a cloth with an egg, bury it at a crossroads, and never look back.|
|5|Pass the curse to someone else (this typically requires learning how the curse was done and then passing it to another person in the same way, but there are also more creative ways to make this happen).|
|6|Collect five birds, five beetles, five cats, five fish, and five young winds.|
|7|Die and return to life, which usually (but not always) takes advantage of a loophole that says death will end a curse.|
|8|Take three golden leaves from a golden tree to make tea with; drink the tea and read the leaves; then complete the task they suggest.|
|9|Kill the one who cast the curse (or otherwise find a way for them to die).|
|10|Find a poem of which there is only one written copy, read it backward each morning for seven mornings in a row, and then burn the item upon which the poem is written.|

### BLESSINGS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 52)

When someone is blessed, it typically means that they are more likely to receive a beneficial GM intrusion when they roll a 1 (or when the GM deems it appropriate to give them an intrusion). The Blessing Intrusions table provides examples of positive GM intrusions that a blessed character might receive.

#### BLESSING INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 52)

Blessing Intrusions

|d6|Blessing|
|---|---|
|1|Someone randomly gives the character a small gift.|
|2|When the character speaks, gold coins fall from their mouth.|
|3|A necessary item, map, or clue falls into the character's lap.|
|4|The weather is suddenly in the character's favor.|
|5|Someone nearby just happens to have the thing the character needs.|
|6|A cypher or artifact works even better than expected.|

### WISHES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 53)

Wishes can be granted via objects, creatures such as genies, or as part of a bargain. When the character asks for a wish, the GM assigns it a level. The larger and more difficult the wish, the higher the level. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7.

In order for a wish to be granted, the character must succeed on an Intellect-related task (usually persuasion or possibly intimidation) equal to the wish's level. On a failed roll, the wish is either not granted at all or is partially granted, depending on the wish and the creature or object that is granting it.

Even if a wish is granted, the character may not get exactly what they want, especially if the wish is poorly worded, has multiple interpretations, or asks for something that is utterly impossible (such as destroying the entire world).

## FAIRY TALE GM INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 53)

GM intrusions present fantastic opportunities to imbue fairy tale games with a bit more weirdness, wonder, and whimsy, all while making the game more interesting and surprising for characters. The GM intrusions included in this section are more specifically designed with fairy tale magic in mind—they're what could happen when magic goes wrong (or extraordinarily right).

Remember that GM intrusions don't always mean that something has gone wrong or is bad for the players (unless they are curse intrusions). A GM intrusion could be the arrival of a good omen, the sudden reversal of a curse, or something that seems bad at first (like falling down a rabbit hole) but leads to something wonderful in the end (a whole new world to explore!).

The Fairy Tale Intrusions tables are ways to quickly generate intrusions appropriate to a fairy tale aesthetic. Roll on the appropriate table to determine the intrusion that occurs, or choose one that feels right for the situation.

### INTERACTION INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 53)

Interaction Intrusions

|d10|GM Intrusion|
|---|---|
|1|A mischievous brownie attempts to steal an object from the characters in the middle of an important conversation or fight.|
|2|The NPC that the characters are talking to suddenly looks at their watch or the sky, says, "I'm late, I'm late," and disappears.|
|3|A character speaks and all of their words come out backward.|
|4|The creature that the PCs are fighting or interacting with splits into two versions of itself.|
|5|The character that the PCs have been interacting with loses their glamour, and the PCs discover it's not the person they thought it was.|
|6|Death arrives, convinced that one of the characters is someone else.|
|7|An opponent uses magic to gain hidden knowledge about a PC and uses it to their advantage in a fight or debate.|
|8|The North Wind has taken a liking to one of the characters and does something to help them succeed in their actions.|
|9|One of the PCs inadvertently (or purposefully) offends someone, and they are instantly turned into a frog.|
|10|An opponent holds up a mirror or other reflective surface at just the right moment, reflecting a spell or ability back on the character.|

### WORLD INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 54)

World Intrusions

|d10|GM Intrusion|
|---|---|
|1|One or more characters accidentally damage or offend a plant of some type, causing it to retaliate.|
|2|A wren starts singing at a nearby crossroads, warning that something's coming.|
|3|One of the characters trips and falls into a rabbit hole.|
|4|Someone steals the moon just as the PCs are about to do an important task that requires moonlight.|
|5|The tree that the characters are sitting under wakes up. Perhaps it is hungry, or maybe it just wants company.|
|6|The path that the characters have been following turns into a rushing river beneath their feet.|
|7|Someone casting a curse nearby accidentally catches one of the characters in the magic, causing them to be affected (roll on the Curse table to determine the effect).|
|8|A mountain rises up suddenly between the place where the characters stand and the place they need to get to.|
|9|Somewhere far off, a magical effect backfires, causing a stampede of wild animals to run right toward the characters.|
|10|One of the characters smells gingerbread. The scent is so tempting, they have a hard time turning away from it.|

### ITEM INTRUSIONS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 54)

Item Intrusions

|d10|GM Intrusion|
|---|---|
|1|A magical ability, cypher, or Artifacts does exactly what it's supposed to, but also creates a weird side effect that affects a nearby friend (or foe).|
|2|A piece of equipment whispers lies into the character's ear, making a convincing argument that their friends are not loyal.|
|3|A magical weapon breaks in the middle of combat and starts to cry.|
|4|A character's belt turns into a snake and starts tightening around their middle.|
|5|A random object begins to wiggle and crack, as though it's about to hatch.|
|6|The character's weapon or armor begins to yell loudly for help while the PC is trying to sneak or hide.|
|7|A previously opened box, bottle, jar, or other container has locked itself back up, with an important item inside.|
|8|A cypher, artifact, or bit of magic is far more powerful than the characters realized, and affects a much larger area (or has a bigger effect) than they expected it to.|
|9|The glint of a recently acquired object or weapon is so shiny, it attracts the attention of a giant bird, beast, or dragon.|
|10|An item in the character's hand or bag starts to replicate itself over and over.|

---

## FAIRY TALE CYPHERS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 73)

Because magic—and thus magic items— are so prevalent in most fairy tales, cyphers in particular should be easy for characters to replenish. If you're using subtle cyphers, you can choose how they arrive—on magic storms, perhaps, or in pockets of magic that exist throughout the world. Or maybe the magic is such that it just works, ensuring that cyphers show up whenever the characters need them.

Manifest cyphers should be readily available too—likely they can be found for cheap at a local market, stashed in hollow tree trunks or bird nests, or scattered about the forest floor. Manifest cyphers may also be integrated into people's clothing or furnishings as unique adornments.

In a fairy tale setting, cyphers often appear as a simple object, such as a poisoned apple or a matchbook. They can also be something intangible, such as three wishes or a magic word. The shifting state of magic in fairy tales makes it easy to use both manifest and subtle cyphers in the same setting and campaign if you desire.

In settings full of magic, cyphers should be both readily available and regularly used. If the PCs are hoarding or saving their cyphers, feel free to give them a reason to use them. And have a list of replacement cyphers ready so the players never have to go without.

Typically, something like a handful of magic beans or apple seeds is considered a single cypher even though there are multiple items.

### CYPHER LIMITS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 73)

All characters have a maximum number of cyphers they can have at any one time. If a character ever attempts to carry more cyphers than their limit, the magic within the cyphers quickly begins to attract fey beings. Fey beings may react by stealing one or more cyphers, cursing the character, or even stealing the character away to a fey realm.

#### FEY BEING TABLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 74)

Fey Being Table

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Faerie|
|2|Changeling|
|3|Goblin|
|4|Nymph|
|5|Pixie|
|6|Ogre|

Obviously, having a fey being steal a character away to their realm is a story-changer. If you're using this as an option, figure out ahead of time what type of fey is attracted, what their realm is like, and how to play out the character's disappearance and possible retrieval.

#### FEY CYPHER ATTRACTION

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 74)

Fey Cypher Attraction

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Steals one cypher|
|2|Steals two cyphers|
|3|Curses the character|
|4|Curses one cypher, causing it to reduce all stat Pool maximums by 5 until the cypher is used, removed, or destroyed|
|5|Causes two or more cyphers to react with each other, destroying them and inflicting damage equal to the level of the more powerful cypher|
|6|Steals the character away to their fey realm|

### FAIRY TALE CYPHER FORMS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 75)

While characters can find or purchase many of these items in the world, only magic versions of the items are cyphers. Characters should easily be able to tell when an item is magic (and thus a cypher) and when it's an ordinary item.

Fey Cypher Attraction

|d20|Form|
|---|---|
|1|Apple or ball of yarn|
|2|Pebble or mushroom|
|3|Scroll or four-leaf clover|
|4|Lock of hair or hand mirror|
|5|Matchstick or comb|
|6|Feather or acorn|
|7|Egg or apple seeds|
|8|Tea or fish scales|
|9|Fingernail clippings or chalk|
|10|Magic beans or key|
|11|Rose or bell|
|12|Small cake or talisman|
|13|Wolf's tooth or hand mirror|
|14|Vial of liquid or secret|
|15|Magic coin or broken arrow|
|16|Wish or fairy dust|
|17|Magic word or spindle|
|18|Curse or handkerchief|
|19|Spell or hand fan|
|20|Fallen star or playing card|

## A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE CYPHERS

### ADDERSTONE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 77)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Stone with a hole in the middle
    
- **Effect:** For the next day, provides the character with one of the following benefits. Roll a d20 or choose from the table.
    
    Adderstones are sometimes also called hagstones, seer stones, and holey stones.
    
    Beware false adderstones, which are made by enterprising swindlers who drill or carve a hole out of a regular stone and attempt to pass it off as something more.
    
    If a character has no hair in which to tie an adderstone, perhaps they can "borrow" some from a friend, a domesticated animal, or a foe.
    

Adderstone Effects

|d20|Effect|
|---|---|
|1–3|When looking through the hole, the user gains an asset to seeing things that are normally invisible to the eye, including doorways, beings, spirits, magical effects, and so on.|
|4–6|When worn on the finger as a ring, wards off spirits of the dead (grants +1 Armor against attacks from ghosts, haunts, and other spirits of the dead).|
|7–9|When attached to physical armor, adds 1 to the Armor it provides (adds 2 to the Armor if the cypher is level 6 or higher).|
|10–12|When held in the mouth, protects against poisons (up to the level of the cypher).|
|13–15|When placed on the finger of another with good intent, it adds 1 to the recovery rolls of both the user and the wearer.|
|16–18|When worn on a string around the neck, provides training in two noncombat skills of the user's choice that they are not already trained in.|
|19–20|When tied in the hair, eases all defense tasks against curses by two steps.|

### AGATE EYE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 77)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Striped stone that looks like a dragon's eye
    
- **Effect:** When ground up and added to food or drink, or applied to the skin, renders the user immune to poisons of the cypher level or lower for one hour per cypher level (and ends any such ongoing effects, if any, already in the user's system).
    

### ANIMATED WOOD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 77)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Chunk of pine, alder, or other wood imbued with magical properties
    
- **Effect:** Writing a word, such as "child," "horse," or "sword," on the wood causes it to become a living version of that word. The living version is no bigger than 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m) and its level is equal to the cypher level. It can make attacks or perform actions as commanded to the best of its abilities and lasts for one hour per cypher level. Commanding it is not an action.
    

Once activated, animated wood is not an unthinking, docile being. It may, in fact, resist the user's commands and attempt to take its own actions. Any actions it takes cannot be harmful to the user or the user's allies. The user may attempt to stop an unwanted action via persuasion, intimidation, and so on (any such tasks against the animated wood are eased by two steps).

### ANYWHERE DOOR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Chalk, pen, pencil, lipstick, or marker
    
- **Effect:** Creates a door to anywhere. The door remains for one day, and then disappears. While the door exists, anyone or anything that can discern the door can use it. Erasing the drawn line erases the door.
    

### APPLE OF DISCORD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Beautiful golden apple that catches the eye of all who see it
    
- **Effect:** When tossed up to a long distance away, it affects all foes in short range of the apple, causing them to attempt to take it for themselves. Foes spend their next two actions doing nothing but fighting among themselves for possession of the apple.
    

### AZURE DUST

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Handful of dust from the Fairy with the Turquoise Hair
    
- **Effect:** Sprinkling the dust on someone's hair, skin, outfit, or other object permanently dyes it bright blue.
    

### BABA YAGA'S SPICED COOKIE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Rye cookie flavored with spices and honey
    
- **Effect:** Eating the cookie increases the user's Intellect Edge by 1 for one hour.
    

### BELLMAN'S MAP OF THE OCEAN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Blank sheet of paper rolled and tied with a hair tie
    
- **Effect:** When unrolled, convinces everyone within short range that the character holding the map knows far more than they do. For the next ten minutes, affected beings look upon the map-holder as their leader or guide, will not attack them, and generally will do as they ask (all social interactions with those affected are eased by two steps).
    

### BELOVED'S KISS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Ruby red ring
    
- **Effect:** When pressed to the lips of a character, beloved's kiss prevents the occurrence of one specific condition of the cypher level or lower. Additionally, it ends any such ongoing effect, if any, in the user's system. Roll a d6 to determine the result.
    

Beloved's Kiss Effects

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1–2|Renders the character immune to poisons for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects)|
|3–4|Renders the character immune to curses for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects)|
|5–6|Renders the character immune to mental effects for one hour per cypher level (and ends any ongoing effects)|

### BIRD'S NEST CORONET

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Beautifully woven bird's nest
    
- **Effect:** When worn like a crown, the bird's nest creates an illusion over the wearer, making them appear like royalty. Others are more likely to follow their suggestions, defer to their wishes, and treat them well. All social interactions are eased by two steps for one day. Seeing through the disguise is an Intellect task equal to the cypher's level.
    

### BLACKBIRD PIE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 78)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Four-and-twenty blackbirds baked in a pie
    
- **Effect:** When the pie is cut open, the blackbirds begin to sing a haunting dirge of pain and sorrow. All foes within long range who hear the song are hindered on all tasks for ten minutes.
    

### BLOOD PEARL BLOSSOM

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Rare blood-red flower with a beautiful pearl in its center
    
- **Effect:** When ingested, removes one curse (of the cypher level or lower) from the user. The curse-removal process can take from one round to one day, depending on the level, severity, and type of curse.
    

### BONE KEY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, 79)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Human finger bone carved into a skeleton key
    
- **Effect:** Unlocks one lock of the cypher level or lower, or provides an asset to open a lock of higher level.
    

### BONES OF THE BELOVED

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Handful of ground bones
    
- **Effect:** When eaten, the bones begin a process of lowering the eater's apparent age. Over the next three days, the user begins to look younger and younger, until they reach the appearance of someone no younger than their mid-twenties. Their hair shines, their teeth glow, their wrinkles disappear, their back unstoops. The effect lasts for three days (five days if the cypher is level 6 or higher). This does not change the actual health or age of the character.
    

### BOWL OF PORRIDGE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Just-right bowl of porridge
    
- **Effect:** Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user's Might Pool. Also protects the user from the effects of cold for ten minutes.
    

### CAT SIDHE MEDALLION

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Medallion in the shape of the white symbol on a cat sidhe's chest
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the medallion protects the wearer from the next curse (of the cypher level or lower) that is cast upon them. The curse goes into the medallion, which shatters into thousands of tiny pieces.
    

### CHESHIRE SMILE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Mischievous grin
    
- **Effect:** When hung in the air, the grin slowly transforms into a grey Cheshire Cat that seems to be made mostly of smoke and shadow. It has huge blue eyes and an enormous grin. The cat acts as a creature (level equal to the cypher's level) with a mind of its own, although it likely helps the person who activated the cypher. It sticks around for ten minutes, and then fades away slowly, until even the original smile has disappeared.
    

### COALHEART'S BEARD BALM

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 79)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Jar of balm
    
- **Effect:** When rubbed on the face, the balm grows into a long, golden beard in about ten minutes. When the user tugs on their beard, it points them in the direction of valuable treasure, the location of which was previously unknown to the user. If someone else cuts the beard before the treasure is found, it loses its power. After the treasure is found, the beard remains. But once it is shaved or cut, it does not grow back.
    

Many dwarfs have beards with magical powers. It's possible to find other beard balm cyphers out in the world.

### CROC'S CLOCK

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Tiny ticking clock, no bigger than a thumbnail
    
- **Effect:** When attached to (or swallowed by) a living creature or an object, the clock ticks loudly, alerting everyone within long range to its presence for one day.
    

### CROWN JEWEL

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Shining jewel from a royal crown
    
- **Effect:** When attached to an item such as a weapon, shield, armor, cypher, or artifact, creates an exact duplicate of the item. The duplicate works just like the original and lasts for ten minutes or until it naturally depletes (whichever comes first).
    

### DAME TROT'S CAT

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Statue of a cat
    
- **Effect:** When activated by feeding it a bit of milk or fish, the statue protects the user, yowling and hissing the next time it senses danger. The cat's level is equal to the cypher level.
    

### DARNING NEEDLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Needle with a large eye
    
- **Effect:** When activated, grows into a larger version of itself that acts as a medium weapon. It inflicts 4 points of damage and causes anything it successfully hits to shrink to half its size. The needle lasts for a number of hours equal to the cypher's level.
    

### DEAD WATER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Vial, pot, or jar of black liquid
    
- **Effect:** Brings a character back to life. However, they come back with a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Might Pool.
    

### DEATHLESS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Needle inside an egg
    
- **Effect:** When a character places their soul inside the needle and places the needle inside the egg, they are protected from their next death. When the character dies, they return to life on the next round, with all of their Pools full.
    
    Using the deathless does not protect the character from taking damage or moving down the damage track. Placing the soul and returning to life are actions. Once the cypher holds the user's soul, it no longer counts against their cypher limit.
    

If someone gets a hold of another person's soul, they have a great deal of power over that person (such as easing all actions against them by three steps). Those who use a deathless should ensure that it's well hidden and well protected.

### DEATH'S CANDLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Small, half-burnt black candle
    
- **Effect:** Once the candle is lit, it burns for a number of rounds equal to the cypher's level. During that time, the user who lit it is protected from death or being moved down the damage track. While the candle burns, if the character would normally die, they do not and instead reject all damage. For example, if a character has 5 points left in their last Pool, and a foe inflicts 5 points of damage on them, putting all their Pools at 0, the user takes no damage. However, if a foe inflicts 4 points of damage, which is not enough to kill the user, the user takes the 4 points of damage.
    

### DEATH'S MESSENGERS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 80)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Bottle, vial, or box filled with three wisps of dark smoke
    
- **Effect:** The three smoke wisps wrap around a creature within close range, causing them to feel dizzy, experience ringing in their ears, and have blurred vision. For the next three rounds, the cypher inflicts damage equal to the cypher's level (each round).
    

### DIADEM OF DEATH

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 81)

### DRAGON'S TEETH

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 81)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Handful of dragon's teeth
    
- **Effect:** When planted, the dragon's teeth grow into three fully armed warriors. The warriors can understand the verbal commands of the person who planted them. Once they are grown, commanding them is not an action. They can make attacks and perform actions to the best of their abilities. The warriors can never go farther than long range from the character who planted them.
    
    Planting the teeth is an action. It takes two rounds for the teeth to grow into warriors. The warriors last for one hour per cypher level.
    

Warriors

 

level 3; Armor 1; swords inflict 3 points of damage

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Walnut or other shelled nut, with hinges and a clasp
    
- **Effect:** The nut opens to reveal a stunning and spectacular ballgown, evening dress, or tuxedo. The outfit is the perfect size, shape, style, and color for the person who wishes to wear it. While worn, the outfit eases all tasks involving charm, persuasion, and etiquette for one hour. After that, the outfit may still be worn, but no longer offers any benefits.
    

Beings of all genders can wear any form of outfit from the dressmaking nut and receive the benefits.

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Pouch of very fine, rainbow-hued dust

- **Form:** Very small cake with the words "EAT ME" written on it in currants

### EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Magical thread sewn onto armor
    
- **Effect:** For the next day, the armor the thread is attached to is invisible, making the wearer appear to be unarmored.
    

### FAIRY CUP

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Decorated vessel made of precious materials
    
- **Effect:** When the cup is buried in the ground, it grants the person who buried it protection. They gain +2 Armor against all physical and mental attacks for one day.
    

It's believed that burying a fairy cup returns it to its rightful owners below ground, and it is they who offer protection by way of thanks.

### FALSE GRANDMOTHER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Pair of wire-rimmed glasses
    
- **Effect:** While wearing the glasses, the user designates one living creature that they can see. For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user is disguised as someone the designated creature knows well. The user has no say in who that person is, but while the disguise is active, all interactions with the designated creature are eased by two steps. The user can remove the glasses to look like themselves again before the end of the duration.
    

### FATHER'S BETRAYAL

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small stone shaped like a heart
    
- **Effect:** For the next ten minutes, a creature that the user can see is banished from an area 30 feet by 30 feet (9 m by 9 m) around the user. If the creature is within that area when the cypher is activated, they are knocked outside the area and are dazed for one round, hindering their next action.
    

### FLAMING ARROW

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Arrow with a silver-white shaft, golden head, and fletching of peacock feathers

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Fresh-picked bouquet of flowers tied with a red ribbon
    
- **Effect:** Giving the flowers to someone else provides both the recipient and the giver an asset in defense against damage of a specified kind for one hour. Roll a d6 to determine the effect.
    

Flowers for Grandmother Effects

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Curses|
|2|Fire/heat|
|3|Ice/cold|
|4|Poison|
|5|Intellect|

### FORGET-ME-KNOT

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Length of magical rope
    
- **Effect:** Knotting the rope together to form a loop allows the user to capture a memory from their past. They don't lose the memory when capturing it with the forget-me-knot. When the user unties the loop, everyone in close range spends one round doing nothing but experiencing the memory as if it were their own. If the memory is particularly sad, loving, scary, and so on, all affected beings likely spend an additional round dealing with the emotional impacts of that memory. Capturing the memory is an action, as is untying the loop.
    

### GENIE'S HANDKERCHIEF

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 82)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Extremely large handkerchief with one corner coated in mercury
    
- **Effect:** Rubbing the cloth over a wound heals the wound (restores all points to the character's Pools), but also uses up one recovery roll for the day.
    

Genie's handkerchiefs come in many colors and materials. Some people find that after their magic is used up, they make fine blankets, curtains, or cloaks. Of course, extended exposure to mercury has its drawbacks.

### GILDED SHELL

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Golden snail shell
    
- **Effect:** When blown into softly, the shell expands into a simple structure with a front door and walls that let in a soft light. From inside the structure, it's about 10 feet by 10 feet by 20 feet (3 m by 3 m by 6 m). From the outside, the shell continues to look exactly the way it did before, in both size and shape, making it difficult for others to notice. Once expanded, the structure is permanent and immobile.
    

### GINGERBREAD MAN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Gingerbread cookie in the shape of a human, lavishly decorated
    
- **Effect:** After eating the cookie, the user has training in Speed defense for the next day.
    

### GODFATHER'S PICTURE BOOK

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Large book full of tales
    
- **Effect:** When someone flips through the pages quickly, time is altered. If the user flips through the book forward, time jumps forward. Flip backward and time jumps backward. Moving time forward gives the user an additional action on their turn. Moving it backward allows them to retry their previous action. After the book is used this way once, it becomes a regular book and does not count against the character's cypher limit.
    

### GOLDEN BEETLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Golden scarab beetle
    
- **Effect:** When dropped into liquid and cooked, it creates enough food to fill the stomachs of all friends and allies within long range.
    

### GOLDEN VANITY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Golden vanity set in a small, sturdy box that includes a brush, comb, and mirror
    
- **Effect:** Each item may be used once and has a different effect:
    
    - _Golden brush:_ Creates bristly terrain in an immediate area, which counts as difficult terrain.
    - _Golden comb:_ Creates jagged, toothy rocks in an immediate area, making it extremely painful to cross. Characters within the area take 1 point of damage each round from the rocks.
    - _Golden mirror:_ Turns into a tall glass mountain 30 feet tall by 300 feet wide (9 m by 90 m). All climbing tasks are hindered, and a fall from any height does 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).
    
    The landscape effects are permanent. The golden vanity counts as a single cypher against the character's cypher limit. When all three items have been used, it remains a functional vanity set but no longer holds any magic.
    

### GREEN SPECTACLES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Pair of glasses with bright green lenses
    
- **Effect:** Once activated, protects the wearer from being blinded or having their vision affected in other ways for one day. The wearer can see through illusions of the cypher level or lower and can see in the dark as if it were daylight.
    

### HART'S HEART

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 83)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Still-beating heart from a forest stag, kept in an ornate lined box

### HEART OF A STAR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Still-warm piece of a fallen star
    
- **Effect:** For the next ten minutes, when the user helps another character while holding the star, that character's task is eased by an additional step. (If the user has an inability in the relevant skill, the other character's task is still eased.)
    

### HEART'S TART

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Red tart in the shape of a heart
    
- **Effect:** When eaten, eases all tasks involving stealing, picking pockets, sneaking, running, surprise, and initiative for ten minutes.
    

### HOT CROSS BUNS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Small spiced cake
    
- **Effect:** When eaten, restores a number of points equal to the cypher's level to the user's Might Pool.
    

### IRON BANDS OF THREE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Three flexible iron bands
    
- **Effect:** Wrapping the iron bands around the user's heart keeps it from breaking with trouble and anxiety. While wearing the bands, the user automatically succeeds on their next three Intellect defense rolls against anything that would make them feel sad, fearful, intimidated, and so on. Each time the cypher activates to protect the user, one of the bands breaks. When all three bands are broken, the cypher is used up.
    

### ITSY BITSY SPIDER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Tiny spider inside a jar, box, or thimble
    
- **Effect:** When released, the spider sets up a web in a nearby corner. For the next ten minutes, the web catches thoughts, secrets, and information about the general area (up to about a square mile), including any creatures, people, weather, or goings on. At the end of that time, the user can read the web, gaining answers to a number of questions equal to the cypher's level. The questions must pertain to the area and must be simple enough that the spider can answer them in three words or less.
    

### JACK'S CANDLESTICK

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Burning candlestick
    
- **Effect:** Jumping over the candlestick restores a number of points equal to the cypher's level to the user's Speed Pool.
    

### JIMINY CRICKET

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 84)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Small wooden or metal cricket
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to retry a task that they failed within the past minute, using the same difficulty and modifiers.
    

### THE KEY OF KNOWING

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Golden key that is permanently stained with blood
    
- **Effect:** When used to open a lock (of the cypher level or lower), grants the user the opportunity to ask three yes-or-no questions about a person, place, or thing. The key answers to the best of its ability and knowledge, and it does not attempt to lie or trick the user with its answer.
    
    After the key is used in this way, the blood disappears from its surface and the key refuses to open anything (or speak) ever again.
    

### KNAVE OF HEARTS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Playing card depicting an elegant knight
    
- **Effect:** Turns the user into the knight depicted on the card. They take on the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of the knight. They also gain +1 Armor, +1 damage, and an asset in sneaking, hiding, and stealth. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

### LION'S COURAGE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Small medallion with the word "COURAGE" inscribed upon it.
    
- **Effect:** When activated, grants the user additional courage in the face of fear. For ten minutes per cypher level, any time the user is attacked and they attempt to make an attack on their next action, that attack is eased and they inflict +1 point of damage.
    

### LIVING WATER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Vial, pot, or jar of liquid
    
- **Effect:** Removes any ongoing damage, lasting damage, or permanent damage the character has. However, the character has a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Might Pool.
    
    When dead water and living water cyphers are used together, a dead character can be brought back to life without any permanent reductions of their Might Pool.
    

### MAGIC BEANS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Handful of magic beans
    
- **Effect:** When planted and watered, the beans grow into a giant beanstalk. It's almost impossible to know where the beanstalk leads until you climb it. Climbing the beanstalk is a level 5 task.
    

### MEMORY'S MATCH

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Matchbox with one match inside
    
- **Effect:** Lighting the match causes everyone nearby to see a vision that comforts them. Those who watch the vision in the flame for one round feel rejuvenated and comforted. Anyone who makes a recovery roll in the next ten minutes gains +3 to the roll. After that, anyone who watched the vision but didn't make a recovery roll takes 3 points of Intellect damage (ignores Armor).
    

### MERMAID TEAR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Tear-shaped drop of sea glass
    
- **Effect:** When swallowed, fills the user with an overwhelming sense of sadness. The user takes 1 point of Intellect damage, but gains an asset on any tasks involving water for the next ten minutes. The task must involve water in a significant way (for example, swinging a sword while it's raining likely doesn't count, but crying as part of an attempt to persuade someone, casting a magic spell involving water, or using a pool to scry would all be appropriate).
    

### NEVERLOST

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 85)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Bag of bread crumbs, pebbles, or candy
    
- **Effect:** When dropped along a path or trail, the items become invisible to everyone except the user and any allies the user designates. The items last for one day per cypher level and can be seen by the user and their allies, even in complete darkness.
    

### NONSENSICAL POEM

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 86)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Nonsense poem written in mirror writing
    
- **Effect:** Reading the poem aloud lets the user reverse one thing about their present situation for up to ten minutes. Up becomes down. Gravity works the other way. A river flows backward. The sun shines at night. (The player should work with the GM to come up with an appropriate and acceptable change.)
    

### OMNISCIENT BEAN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 86)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Magical bean made into a cake
    
- **Effect:** When eaten, the bean allows the user to tap into magic. They can ask the GM one question related to their current task, location, or action and get a general answer. The GM assigns a level to the question, so the more obscure the answer, the more difficult the task. Generally, knowledge that a PC could find by looking somewhere other than their current location is level 1, and obscure knowledge of the past is level 7. The cypher cannot provide an answer to a question above its level (which means it can't provide knowledge about the future, since that is level 10).
    

### PICTURELESS BOOK

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 86)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Book without pictures
    
- **Effect:** Reading the book aloud for one round causes all who hear it within short range (except the user) to fall into a deep sleep for one round. While they sleep, they have intense dreams and cannot take any other actions. The dreams affect them in one of the following ways.
    
    Pictureless book affects NPCs' health instead of their Pools, either restoring them to full health or doing 5 points of damage.
    

Pictureless Book Effects

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1–2|_Sweet dreams._ All dreaming characters have all of their Pools restored to full.|
|3–4|_Nightmares._ All dreaming characters take 5 points of Intellect damage.|
|5–6|_Dream world._ All dreaming characters enter a dream world, where they have an experience that causes them to temporarily learn a noncombat skill of their choice for the rest of the day.|

### POISON FOR YOUR DAUGHTER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 86)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Clear liquid that can be spread on any object, such as an apple, hair comb, or weapon
    
- **Effect:** The poison creates a specific reaction for one hour in a creature who uses the object. Roll d100 to determine the reaction.
    

Poison for Your Daughter Effects

|d100|Reaction|
|---|---|
|01–20|_Sleep._ The creature falls into a deep, dreamless sleep. While sleeping, the creature cannot take any actions, but is protected by a glass coffin that grants +2 Armor. The creature wakes if they are touched by someone they love or if they take damage.|
|21–40|_Disappear._ The creature becomes invisible to everyone and everything for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level. During that time, they cannot be heard, felt, or sensed.|
|41–60|_Alter._ The creature becomes physically altered until they are unrecognizable, even by their loved ones. The alteration also affects their clothing, possessions, and any distinguishing characteristics or mannerisms.|
|61–75|_Lost._ The creature becomes deeply and frighteningly lost, even if they are in familiar surroundings (such as their own bedroom). They do not recognize any landmarks, cannot find their way, and feel a deep sense of panic.|
|76–85|_Breathless._ The creature feels like they are unable to breathe, gulping air and short of breath. Although they are not dying, they feel as though they are. All tasks are hindered.|
|86–95|_Compulsion._ The creature becomes obsessed with a single task, unable to do anything else until they achieve it. The task might be simple (picking the most beautiful rose from a garden) or complex (knitting seven sweaters from nettles). All actions that don't contribute to completing the task are hindered.|
|96–00|_Dutiful._ The creature becomes much easier to interact with. All tasks to influence the poisoned creature are eased by two steps.|

### POISONED APPLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 87)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Apple that is half white and half red
    
- **Effect:** Eating from the white half heals the user, restoring a number of points equal to the cypher's level to their Might Pool. Eating from the red half poisons the user, inflicting damage equal to the cypher's level. Each half of the apple has the power to affect only one creature.
    
    Both halves of the apple can be used by the same or different people as long as it's done within a few rounds of each other. However, in order for the cypher to take effect, the user must willingly take a bite. It's impossible, for instance, to force-feed someone part of the apple and have the cypher activate.
    

### POPPET (DAMAGE)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 87)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with hair and bone
    
- **Effect:** Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure connects the figure with that object or being. Destroying the poppet inflicts damage on the connected object or being equal to the cypher's level, no matter how far away it is. Writing the name and destroying the poppet are separate actions.
    

### POPPET (LOVE)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 87)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small figure made of wax, adorned with flowers and herbs
    
- **Effect:** Giving the poppet to another living being in a short ceremony (usually simply saying the being's name and making an offer of deep positive emotion) protects them from all harmful effects the next time they are attacked. If the positive emotion is returned (such as between friends or lovers), the giver is also protected. For example, the next time someone swings a sword, speaks a curse, or tries to poison the creature, the attempt automatically fails, and if the creature were to slip near a deep pit, they would not fall into it. Giving the poppet to another is an action.
    

### POPPET (PROSPERITY)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 87)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small figure made of cloth, stuffed with herbs and bits of wood
    
- **Effect:** Writing the name of an object or living being on the figure connects the figure with that object or being. Dirtying, tearing, and damaging the poppet causes the connected being or object to appear destitute and poor to all who see them. This effect lasts for a day. Writing the name and damaging the poppet are separate actions.
    

### POPPET (SILENCE)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small figure carved from wood or stone, with an open mouth
    
- **Effect:** Stuffing the open mouth with something that belongs to a living being (such as hair, teeth, or fabric) connects the figure to that being. For the following day, the being is unable to talk about, point to, see, or otherwise engage with the person who activated the poppet.
    

### POWDER OF LIFE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Bit of powder carried in a pepper box
    
- **Effect:** When sprinkled on an inanimate object, the powder brings it to life. The object doesn't change in any way—a small cat made of glass remains a small cat made of glass—except that now it is alive. The living object acts as a level 2 creature with a mind of its own. While it has an affinity or obligation for the one who brought it to life, it doesn't obey commands.
    

Objects animated by the powder of life should have stats that represent their form and nature. For example, a tin soldier brought to life likely has 1 Armor and perhaps a light weapon, while a stuffed rabbit might be level 3 for the purpose of Speed defense, hiding, and sneaking.

**Editor's Notes —** Instructions for _Dr. Pipt's Incredible Powder of Life_:

1. Sprinkle lightly one dusting dose on static object to be brought to life.
2. Raise left hand, little finger pointing upward, and say _"Weaugh!"_
3. Raise right hand, thumb pointing upward, and say _"Teaugh!"_
4. Raise both hands, fingers and thumbs spread wide, and say _"Peaugh!"_
5. Try and keep a positive attitude!

### PRINCESS'S PEA

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Dried pea that was previously slept on
    
- **Effect:** For one hour per cypher level, allows the user to recognize disguises, optical illusions, sound mimicry, false claims, and other such tricks (for all senses) for what they are.
    

### RABBIT HOLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Pocket watch with an empty face
    
- **Effect:** Laying the pocket watch facedown on the ground creates a rabbit hole that goes directly to a place that the user states. The user must have previously been to the stated place, and must enter the rabbit hole before anyone else, ideally by jumping in feet first. The hole grows to the appropriate size to accommodate the user and anyone traveling with them. Travel inside the hole is not instantaneous, but it is very fast, taking no more than a minute and feeling very much like riding a long, winding slide.
    
    The hole stays open for ten minutes, and it is possible to travel back to the starting place (but nowhere else) by again jumping in feet-first.
    

### RAPUNZEL LEAF

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Small green leaf from a rapunzel plant
    
- **Effect:** After being buried beneath a rock, the rapunzel leaf begins to grow into a stone tower that stands 100 feet (30 m) tall. The tower, which takes ten minutes to fully form, has a large number of windows but only one exterior door, which can be unlocked only by the user.
    
    The tower's level is equal to the cypher level, and the structure is permanent and immobile.
    

### ROSE OF RED

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Big, beautiful crimson rose in full bloom
    
- **Effect:** Pricking a finger on the rose's thorns causes the user to bleed a single drop of blood. When flung into the air, the blood becomes a large red bird that flies toward a chosen target up to a long distance away. When it arrives, it bursts in an immediate radius, inflicting Intellect damage equal to the cypher level. The burst spawns 1d6 additional birds; in the next round, each one flies to a random spot within short range and explodes in an immediate radius, inflicting damage equal to the cypher level.
    

### SHADOW SOAP

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 88)

- **Level:** 4
    
- **Form:** Small piece of soap
    
- **Effect:** When rubbed on your visible shadow, causes it to separate from yourself.
    
    The shadow acts as a level 4 creature under the user's control for one hour (or until there is no light). The shadow is two-dimensional and insubstantial, and when sneaking, hiding, and avoiding detection, it acts as a level 7 creature. When the effect ends, the shadow (usually) returns to the user.
    

Shadows are known to develop a mind of their own. Sometimes after tasting a bit of freedom, they refuse to return.

### SHARD OF THE MOON

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Tiny sliver of the moon
    
- **Effect:** Glows softly for ten minutes, drawing all moon-loving creatures (such as moths, moon hares, and werewolves) within long range. For as long as the effect lasts, any attracted creatures will not attack the user or their allies. The user can converse with the creatures and ask them questions, which the creatures will answer to the best of their ability, but always within their nature (so a trickster will still answer as a trickster would, for example).
    

### SHINING KNIFE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Shining knife
    
- **Effect:** When stuck into an object, such as a tree or the side of a house, the knife connects the wielder and someone they choose. If one of them wants to know how the other is faring, all they have to do is return to the spot where the knife is stuck. If both are faring well, the knife shines bright gold. If harm has come to one, the knife is dull and rusted.
    

### SILVER SLIPPERS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Silver shoes, ruby slippers, or red boots
    
- **Effect:** When the wearer speaks aloud the name of the place they wish to go, the silver slippers take them there in three steps. Note that in most cases the slippers only transport the wearer (although companion animals and the like may sometimes travel with them).
    

Once the silver slippers are used to transport their wearer, they disappear. However, it is rumored that they magically return to the world in some form for someone else who needs them.

### SINGING BONE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Human bone carved into the mouthpiece for a musical instrument
    
- **Effect:** When blown into, the bone sings a song that details the weaknesses and faults of one target (up to the level of the cypher) that the user chooses. For ten minutes, all tasks involving the target are eased for everyone in long range who heard the bone's song.
    

For most magical objects involving sound, it's not necessary to physically hear the item in order to gain the benefits. "Hearing" may involve sensing vibrations, magical mental telepathy, a sign language interpreter, and so on.

### SNAKE LEAVES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Three green leaves
    
- **Effect:** When placed upon a person, the leaves restore all Pools to full, move a character one step up the damage track, or bring a dead character back to life. However, the character also gains a permanent 3-point reduction in their maximum Intellect Pool.
    

### SNICKERSNEE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Small jewel, talisman, or bead
    
- **Effect:** When attached to a weapon, causes it to grow two to five times its normal size. The weapon inflicts an additional +2 points of damage, but otherwise can be used as if it were a weapon of its original size.
    

### SONG OF THE DEAD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Small stuffed bird with yellow and blue plumage
    
- **Effect:** When the user spends ten minutes breathing into the mouth of the bird, it comes to life. It flies off, but now carries a piece of the user's life inside it. When the user dies, the bird flies back to their body and is able to communicate to those around it, but only for one day. After that, the bird returns to its lifeless form.
    

### SORCERER'S SKELETON KEY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 89)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Wooden stick, iron wand, or piece of straw
    
- **Effect:** When tapped three times against any locked door or other object (of the cypher level or lower), the key automatically unlocks it.
    

### SPIRIT RING

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Ring, necklace, hairpin, or bracelet
    
- **Effect:** Summons a group of helpful fey who provide assistance for ten minutes. During this time, they do as the wearer commands as long as they're within long range. They can hinder any or all opponents' tasks, provide information, assist in small tasks, and so on. The fey will not do anything that goes against their basic nature and safety (such as self-harm, attacking their friends, or obvious suicide missions).
    

Fey are fickle beings. While spirit rings and the like allow someone to hold power over them, it's very much dependent on the fey's blessing. Angering the fey may cause them to leave at any moment (even in the middle of something important), and they may take the time to curse or prank the characters before they disappear.

### TELEPORT HAT

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Silly hat that is always too large on the wearer no matter what size their head is
    
- **Effect:** Allows the wearer to wish for a creature that they know to appear at their side. The creature must agree to be teleported (or convinced via some type of interaction, such as persuasion or intimidation). The teleported creature stays for as long as both parties agree, but not more than a day. At that time, the creature is returned to their place of origination.
    

### THREE NEEDLES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Three enchanted needles
    
- **Effect:** For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the user can climb any solid surfaces (even vertical ones) as if doing so was a routine task.
    

### TIN MAN'S TEARS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Tiny vial filled with tears
    
- **Effect:** When poured out, spreads out to cover an area about 2 feet by 2 feet (60 cm square), transforming any metal it touches into brittle rust, down to a depth of about 6 inches (15 cm). When used on a metal creature (such as a tin soldier), the rust inflicts damage equal to the cypher's level and hinders all movement actions for ten minutes.
    

### TO PETER WITH LOVE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Wrapped box with a bomb inside and a gift tag on the outside
    
- **Effect:** Write a person's name on the tag, and the box will deliver itself to that person at a time and place you specify. When opened, the box does damage to the recipient equal to the cypher level. Traveling to the recipient takes at least a round and sometimes longer, depending on the distance and difficulty.
    

### VALOROUS WHETSTONE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Sharpening stone
    
- **Effect:** After sharpening at least one of their weapons with the whetstone, the user instantly feels more brave. For the next ten minutes, all of their intimidation actions are eased, and their sharpened weapon inflicts +2 points of damage.
    

### VASE OF TEARS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Vase, vial, or jar filled with tears
    
- **Effect:** Breaking the vase creates a protective spell around the character, preventing them from taking any Might damage the next time they are physically attacked.
    

### WHITE SNAKE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Piece of a magical snake
    
- **Effect:** Upon swallowing the piece of the snake, the user gains the ability to understand and speak with all living things for ten minutes.
    

### WISH-GRANTING PEARL

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 90)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Flaming pearl
    
- **Effect:** The user can make a single wish and have all or part of it come true. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The cypher cannot grant a wish above its level.
    

### WITCH BOTTLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Ornate stoppered bottle filled with wine, seawater, or pins and needles
    
- **Effect:** Captures a witch (of a level up to the cypher's level). Upon entering the bottle, the witch takes damage equal to the cypher's level and is trapped until someone whispers their name into the bottle's mouth and releases them.
    

### WITCH'S LADDER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Garland of knotted string, feathers, teeth, and bells
    
- **Effect:** Safely stores one curse for use at a later time. The stored curse may be released and cast only by the person who stored it, or by someone who has received their permission to do so.
    

### WOODEN SPOON

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Plain wooden spoon
    
- **Effect:** When stirred through the air, restores the user's energy and vitality. The user gains two additional actions on their next turn. For example, they can move a long distance, use a one-action recovery roll, and activate a cypher as their turn, or attack a foe three times.
    

### YONDER YARN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Skein or spool of yarn
    
- **Effect:** Unravels to lead the user to their desired destination. The yarn unspools at the speed that the user would normally walk or ride. The yonder yarn will not enter territory it deems too dangerous, and it cannot go through solid obstacles. If the yarn is cut, it no longer works.
    

It is difficult, but not impossible, to protect oneself from being found by yonder yarn. Witches, in particular, know ways to hide themselves (and others) from the yarn's power.

## FAIRY TALE ARTIFACTS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

Artifacts are typically more valuable and less common. Therefore, player characters are less likely to encounter them at random and more likely to find them in the hands of NPCs, locked or hidden in chests, or for sale by high-end and specialized vendors. Acquiring an artifact should almost always require a sacrifice, trial, or difficult task.

Most artifacts in a Cypher System fairy tale setting are magical objects that have been either crafted via magic or later altered by or imbued with magic. There are a number of people and beings in fairy tale settings who are capable of creating artifacts by one or both of these methods. Additionally, some artifacts are products of magic or the setting itself. Thus, new artifacts are constantly entering the world, just waiting to be found and used by the characters.

### ARTIFACT QUIRKS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 306)(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 91)

Magic runs through most items in a fairy tale world, but especially through artifacts. Magic is unknowable and mystifying, and thus something can—and often does—go wrong. While that may sometimes manifest as GM intrusions, it also shows up in artifacts as quirks. Every artifact has a quirk that sets it apart from mundane or lightly magical objects.

Any of the Fantasy Artifacts would be suitable for a fairy tale setting. However, every fairy tale artifact should come with a quirk that sets it apart from a simple "wand of fire" or similar item. Come up with your own or roll a quirk on the table below.

Quirks typically do not make an artifact more powerful, but they can make it more interesting, difficult, useful, or just unique. Some quirks manifest during an item's creation, while others might appear (or disappear) after a particular experience, usually one involving magic. Quirks may come and go without notice, but typically an artifact can have only one quirk at a time and is rarely without a quirk for long.

#### ARTIFACT QUIRKS TABLE (D10)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 306)

Fairy Tale Artifact Quirks (d10)

|d10|Quirk|
|---|---|
|1|Is sometimes invisible.|
|2|Cries like a baby if jostled.|
|3|Becomes cold as ice to the touch and emits cold vapor when danger threatens.|
|4|Contains a secret compartment that invariably holds a chunk of rock broken from what might be a strange jade sculpture.|
|5|Also serves as a key to some magically locked doors and chests.|
|6|Bites owner with tiny teeth if jostled, dealing 1 point of damage.|
|7|Always muttering and complaining, though useful warnings and other information can sometimes be gained.|
|8|Jealous of any other manifest cyphers, artifacts, or beautiful objects in the wielder's life.|
|9|The "painting" of a princess of summer on the object sometimes leaves it, robbing the artifact of power.|
|10|Causes flowers to grow wherever it is stored or set down.|

#### ARTIFACT QUIRKS TABLE (D20)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 92)

Fairy Tale Artifact Quirks (d20)

|d20|Quirk|
|---|---|
|1|Randomly changes the color of weapons, clothing, and other objects it touches.|
|2|Causes some animals to shy away from it, and others to draw near to it.|
|3|Musical instruments and birdsongs go flat in its presence.|
|4|Gives the wielder an increased sense of smell.|
|5|Draws bees and occasionally drips honey.|
|6|Sometimes catches on fire when used; the blaze doesn't do damage but it gives off heat and light.|
|7|Produces a rash, tattoo, or other mark on the wielder's skin.|
|8|Causes the wielder to walk an inch or so above the ground.|
|9|Whistles music appropriate to what's going on around it, including a nasal drone when it's bored.|
|10|Sometimes moves of its own accord, but never when anyone's looking at it.|
|11|Talks constantly about its former owner, who it either loves or hates, depending on the day.|
|12|Gives everyone nearby weird and unnatural dreams.|
|13|Causes the wielder's hair to grow faster than normal.|
|14|Creates a cloud over itself constantly. Sometimes the cloud rains.|
|15|Draws fey creatures to it, whether it's being used or not.|
|16|Whines incessantly if it hasn't been used (or at least given some attention, such as being cleaned) in at least a day.|
|17|Emits various colored swirls and sparkles that form shapes in the air.|
|18|Changes appearance in some small way to match the wielder's mood.|
|19|Sometimes points the way to something interesting or useful.|
|20|Occasionally changes into a completely different artifact overnight (including form and function); this effect lasts until the artifact is used in its new form, after which point it reverts back (or depletes).|

## A SELECTION OF FAIRY TALE ARTIFACTS

### A TISKET A TASKET

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 93)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Woven yellow basket with wooden handles
    
- **Effect:** This basket can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical cat. Cyphers in the basket do not count against a character's limit.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the basket)
    

### BOUNDING BOOTS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 93)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Beautifully made leather and gold boots that adjust to fit the wearer perfectly
    
- **Effect:** The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** —
    

### BOUNDLESS BAG

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 93)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small bag with two handles and a clasp
    
- **Effect:** Any nonliving item held in the bag becomes a slightly more valuable item. For example, an inexpensive item becomes a moderately priced item, while a moderate item becomes an expensive item. The bag has no effect on items that are very expensive or exorbitant. The change takes a full day to take effect, during which time the item cannot leave the bag and the bag should not be opened. If the bag is opened, the process is canceled and must be started over.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6. When the effect depletes, it can still be used as a normal bag.
    

Putting all or part of a living thing into a boundless bag is always risky, as more than one person has had their hand or head turned to gold (which might sound lovely, but typically isn't). Also, doing so often causes the boundless bag to revert to a normal bag.

Items that create wealth in any fashion are particularly sought after. So much so that some items are believed to be cursed, due to the number of people who have met their untimely fate while in possession of a wealth-making artifact.

### BOY BLUE'S HORN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 93)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Gleaming horn that never needs to be tuned or polished
    
- **Effect:** When playing a lullaby, the horn puts every hearing living being in short range (including the user) to sleep for two rounds. When the horn plays something upbeat, the user and all allies within short range add +1 to their recovery rolls for ten minutes.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20. After depletion, it continues to function as a regular horn.
    

### CARVING KNIFE OF SHARPNESS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 93)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Knife (light weapon)
    
- **Effect:** This weapon functions as a normal knife of its kind. When the wielder gets a special major effect when attacking, they can choose to lop off one of the target's limbs.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (roll on each major effect)
    

The GM determines the effect of a lost limb; however, many magical beings can withstand lost limbs with far more aplomb than a mortal creature will display in a similar situation.

### DEVILS AND TAILORS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 94)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Blood-stained draughtboard with figures of white gold, bronze, and pearl
    
- **Effect:** Playing someone in a game of checkers or draughts eases all of the user's positive social interactions with their opponent. While playing, the user can make a move and interact with their opponent as a single action. The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each game played). After depletion, the board continues to function as a regular draughtboard.
    

You can determine the outcome of a game by having both players roll 2d6. The player with the highest number of pieces left on the board (highest roll) is the winner.

### FIDDLE OF THE FOSSEGRIM

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 94)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Water-worn fiddle
    
- **Effect:** Playing the fiddle causes everyone within long distance to become enticed by the music and draw closer to the player. After one round, all creatures in short range begin to dance uncontrollably for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. The only action they can take while dancing is to attempt to break free from the effect (an Intellect action equal to the artifact level).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### FORTUNATE'S PURSE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 94)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Elegant knapsack that shifts colors to hide in plain sight
    
- **Effect:** Any object put inside the sack cannot be detected by physical senses or magic. The sack can hold a single item, of any size and shape, at a time. Cyphers in Fortunate's purse do not count against the user's cypher limit.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each time an item is added to the knapsack)
    

Magic bags come in many forms, such as coin purses, sacks, packs, and pockets. Some can be used to hide someone safely out of sight, provide an endless supply of gold or riches, or grant wishes. They are most often given as rewards for doing great kindnesses or completing a difficult task.

### GALOSHES OF FORTUNE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 94)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Pair of rubber boots
    
- **Effect:** Transports the wearer to a time and place in the past or present that they desire for up to ten minutes. The wearer cannot be seen, heard, or sensed by others, and they cannot take any actions other than to watch events unfold. Traveling to and from the time and place causes the wearer to disappear from the present for two rounds.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

### GENIE'S LAMP

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Bronze oil lamp
    
- **Effect:** Rubbing the lamp produces a genie who grants the user a wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

Genies, also called djinni, djinn, or jinn, come in many forms, and not all of them are contained or controlled by something so simple as a lamp.

### GOLDEN BRIDLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Bridle made of flowing gold
    
- **Effect:** To activate the bridle, the user must succeed on an Intellect interaction with a beast whose level does not exceed the artifact level. The bridle bonds to the creature, which immediately becomes calm. The creature awaits the user's commands and carries out orders to the best of its ability. The creature remains calmed for a number of hours equal to the artifact's level minus the creature's level. (If the result is 0 or less, the creature is enslaved for only one minute.)
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### HATCHET OF THE WOODSMAN

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Well-worn hatchet of unremarkable appearance
    
- **Effect:** When used on a creature, the hatchet turns the target into wood and inflicts damage equal to its level. If the creature is living wood, the hatchet turns them into nonliving wood. If the target is slain by the hatchet, the creature becomes animated wood. Effects last for ten minutes or until the target succeeds on an Intellect roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check on each successful attack)
    

### HOOK'S HOOK

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Simple iron hook designed to be worn as a prosthetic
    
- **Effect:** When placed on an amputated limb, the hook grafts on permanently. It works as a simple hook and as a light weapon. When activated, Hook's hook affects the minds of all thinking foes within long range. Those affected are instilled with terror, making them drop whatever they're holding and flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (for the fear ability). After depletion, it still functions as a hook and a weapon.
    

There are rumored to be any number of Hook's hooks, all of which are made from different materials and serve different purposes, such as the scissors hook, oar hook, magnet hook, teacup hook, grappling-hook hook, and fishing rod hook. Enterprising characters might seek out multiple hooks, along with a way to exchange them easily.

### HORN OF DESTRUCTION

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Large brass horn
    
- **Effect:** Blowing into the horn destroys all objects in an immediate area that is up to a long distance away, turning it all into rubble and debris. Living beings inside the area take 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

It is customary for the one who holds the horn of destruction to call themselves the King of Rubble and Debris and to wear a crown fashioned from talus and scree.

### IRON STOVE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 95)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Iron stove that walks and talks
    
- **Effect:** Once per day, the stove can bake a living gingerbread cookie. The baker chooses the form, but it must be a simple, one-dimensional shape (such as a human, a dog, or a tree). The cookie is a level 3 creature that can move, talk, and complete simple tasks that the baker asks of it. After a day, the cookie crumbles away.
    
    Additionally, the iron stove can be used as a regular stove to heat water, cook meals, and so on.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100. After depletion, it remains a regular working stove, but no longer walks and talks.
    

A gingerbread being is not immune to dangers. Large amounts of liquids are likely to make it melt away, while birds and other scavengers have been known to try to take an eye or leg.

### KNAPSACK OF SEVENS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 96)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Simple knapsack
    
- **Effect:** Tapping the knapsack seven times causes seven swans to fly out. For as long as the user does not speak or make any sounds, the swans fly around the user, providing them with +1 Armor against mental and physical attacks for the next ten minutes.
    
    As soon as the user utters a sound, the swans return to the knapsack.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### MIRROR MIRROR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 96)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Ornate mirror that grows or shrinks in size according to its user's needs.
    
- **Effect:** When the user looks into the mirror and interacts with it, it grants their request, as it is able. Roll a d6 to determine the mirror's ability:
    

Mirror Mirror Abilities

|d6|Ability|
|---|---|
|1|Answers a question about the present (such as "Who is the fairest of them all?") with a simple one- or two-word answer.|
|2|Allows the viewer to check in on someone they know (and who knows them) from anywhere. The image lasts just a moment, and those being viewed are not aware that it has happened.|
|3|If the viewer stands before the mirror and shouts their own name three times, they are granted a glimpse of their future. This glimpse lasts just a moment, and is not guaranteed to come true.|
|4|If the viewer stands before the mirror at midnight while holding a light source, they are able to contact the ghost or spirit of a person or creature they know the name of. Whether or not the being agrees to talk with them is another matter.|
|5|Distorts the appearance of everything it reflects, particularly by magnifying the horrible and ugly aspects of things and people while ignoring their good and beautiful aspects. Looking into the mirror inflicts 2 points of Intellect damage. Angling the mirror to reflect an object inflicts 2 points of damage to it.|
|6|Coats the user's skin with its reflective surface, offering protection. The first time the user would take damage, the mirror shatters instead, reflecting the damage back to the user's attacker.|

- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

Most mirror mirrors have a personality all their own. Some sing their answers, some show images, and still others sigh with boredom at being asked the same thing over and over. Mirrors never lie. Except when they do.

### PANDORA'S BOX

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 96)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Elegant gold box with a hinged lid and a locked clasp
    
- **Effect:** When the box is opened, light leaks out. The light coalesces into a golden form that represents a deep sense of peace and hope to the person who opened the box. For a number of rounds equal to the artifact level, the golden form eases all actions taken by the opener. Alternatively, the opener can share the effect of the golden form as their action, easing all actions taken by allies within short range (but not giving themselves the benefits).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

### PIXIE DUST

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Glass bottle filled with glittering light
    
- **Effect:** Effect: Shake the glittering light on a living being and it can fly for ten minutes per artifact level. If the being can already fly, shaking the light on them grounds them, taking away their ability to be airborne for the same amount of time.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d1
    

### RED CAP

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Woolen cap soaked in human blood
    
- **Effect:** The wearer gains an extra recovery roll each day that is not an action and does not count toward their daily limit. Once the wearer uses this recovery roll, they can't do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll and soak the hat in fresh human blood.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use)
    

### RED RIDING HOOD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Bright red cloak that adjusts to fit its wearer
    
- **Effect:** Draws the eye while also giving the wearer the impression of being easy prey. All tasks involving sneaking and hiding are hindered, and foes will typically attack the wearer over any others in the area. The cloak provides +3 Armor and an asset to all Might-based tasks, including combat tasks.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (check each day of use)
    

### SELF-SWINGING SWORD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Steel sword with an ornate hilt
    
- **Effect:** When activated by a special word, the sword attacks whoever the user indicates, fighting as a creature whose level is equal to the artifact level. Commanding the sword is not an action, but it can only do things that a sword would be able to do (attack, block, slice, and so on). If the sword is reduced to 0 health, the self-swinging ability ends and must be reactivated. The sword returns to the user when the duration ends.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (for the self-swinging ability). After depletion, it functions as a regular sword.
    

### SEVEN-LEAGUE BOOTS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Lace-up knee-high boots of black leather
    
- **Effect:** Allows the wearer to travel up to 21 miles (34 km) with a single step. Alternatively, two people may each wear one boot and travel up to 10.5 miles (19 km) with a single step. Seven-league boots exhaust the user, costing them 2 Might points per step.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each step). Once the movement ability depletes, the boots continue to function as regular boots.
    

### SHAPESHIFTER WAND

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 97)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Wand made of wood, glass, metal, or stone
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to turn one living being (including themself) into one of the following: flower, lake, duck, swan, cottage, rosebush, or fish. While in their new form, the shapeshifted being retains all of their health and other attributes, but cannot perform any actions beyond what the non-magical item or creature could normally perform. So a flower can blow in the wind, bloom, attract insects, be cut, and smell nice. Any attempts to detect the shapeshifted being by physical senses or magic are hindered by two steps. While shapeshifted, the being cannot die; however, they can be injured, cursed, or moved down the damage track. The effect lasts for ten minutes or until the user chooses to end it early.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### SHE-BEAR

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Bit of wood carved in the shape of a bear
    
- **Effect:** When placed in the mouth, changes the wielder into the form of a female bear. While in this form, the user gains +4 to their Might Pool, +4 to their Speed Pool, and +1 to Armor. They also can communicate with other bears while in this form. The effect lasts for ten minutes.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

### SHIRT OF NETTLES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Woven shirt of stinging nettles
    
- **Effect:** The shirt acts as light armor, but grants an additional +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher) in addition to the 1 Armor that light armor typically provides. Additionally, the wearer can't be shapeshifted against their will.
    
- **Depletion:** — (At any time, the GM can rule that the shirt has resisted enough shapeshifting magic to deplete that ability, after which the shirt still functions as armor.)
    

### SOLDIER'S CLOAK OF INVISIBILITY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Slate-grey cloak sewn of shadows and silence
    
- **Effect:** Provides an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic) for as long as the wearer does not interact with another creature. Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### SOULFUL FIDDLE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Fiddle made of bone and guts
    
- **Effect:** This instrument acts like a normal fiddle of its kind. If the wielder is trained in its use and plays an appropriate tune, those within short range who hear it suffer one of the following effects: fall asleep, become amenable to suggestion, follow the fiddle player in a light trance, or take a similar action.
    
    The desired effect must be the same for all creatures who hear it. The effect lasts for ten minutes, but actions by others (such as attacking the listeners or physically restraining them) can end the effect early for a creature.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small tin soldier with one leg
    
- **Effect:** Gives a user who is missing a limb the ability to transform the tin soldier into a prosthetic limb with the appearance of their choosing. The limb permanently increases the user's maximum Speed Pool or Might Pool (user's choice) by 5 points (or 7 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** —
    

It is rumored that there are a number of artifacts that create prosthetic body parts or restore missing limbs, including Paper Ballerina, Handless Maiden, and Bianca's Snake.

### STONE CANOE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 98)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Shiny grey pebble, small enough to fit into a pocket
    
- **Effect:** When activated, forms into a canoe that can carry a number of beings (and their equipment) equal to the artifact level. The canoe lasts for one day and then transforms back into a pebble.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (check each use)
    

### STORY KNIFE

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 99)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small penknife inscribed with tiny words in hundreds of languages
    
- **Effect:** Slices through words that are in the form of oral stories, songs, speeches, conversations, and so on. This has one of two effects, depending on the wielder's desire (the wielder must decide before they activate the artifact each time):
    
    - Makes the story, song, and so on sharper, stronger, and more interesting, increasing the chance that it will have an impact on listeners (eases any attempted interaction task)
    - Makes the story, song, and so on boring, unwieldy, and disjointed, decreasing the chance that it will have the intended impact on listeners (hinders any attempted interaction task)
    
    Using the story knife is an action. It has no power to cut physical objects or living beings (unless those beings are made of stories).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### TABLE-BE-SET

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 99)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Common-looking wooden table
    
- **Effect:** Putting the table out and saying "Table be set" automatically fills the table with as much food and drink as will fit upon its surface. The table does not become empty as long as there is anyone in long range who still wishes to eat. Once a character uses the table's ability, they can't do so again until after they make a ten-hour recovery roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

In addition to artifact quirks, common sense suggests that the effects of some artifacts will draw additional interesting opportunities or dangers. Using table-be-set in the middle of a forest, for example, is likely to draw bears and other hungry beasts, while using it in the middle of town might garner the characters new friends, or catch the attention of thieves.

### TINDERBOX

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 99)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Small ornate tinderbox made of metal
    
- **Effect:** Summons three dogs to do the user's bidding. The dogs can complete any tasks dogs would normally be able to accomplish, including carrying, fetching, attacking, defending, and so on. They act as a single level 3 creature.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

### TWEEDLEDEE'S UMBRELLA

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 99)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Large umbrella with a sharp point on the end
    
- **Effect:** Touch a creature (up to the artifact's level) of any size and the umbrella will fold up around it, capturing it inside. Holding the umbrella with the captive inside is an action. A caught character is held for ten minutes or until they make a successful Might roll to break free.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### VICIOUS TANKARD

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 99)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Hefty ale tankard carved of stone
    
- **Effect:** In addition to serving as a convenient means to drink a variety of liquids, if the tankard is topped off with good ale or spirits, it can be used as a medium weapon that inflicts +2 damage (for a total of 6 points of damage). Anyone who picks up the tankard is practiced in using it in this fashion. Surprisingly, using the tankard as a melee weapon does not cause more than a modicum of good ale or spirits to slosh out.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each fight)

## FAIRY TALE CREATURES

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 100)

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 106)

- **Bagheera:** This cunning, bold, and brilliant black panther can be someone's worst enemy or their most loyal friend, protector, and mentor.
    
- **Beast (with a capital B):** Sometimes a human cursed, sometimes an animal blessed, often just a creature from the beginning, Beasts are bestial humanoids with large claws and jaws. Most Beasts have a single thing that they love deeply and will do anything to protect: a garden, a human, their home, a book from their childhood.
    
- **Cheshire Cat:** Interacting with this riddling, punning, disappearing striped cat is enough to make anyone feel discombobulated. Can make a great ally if you're seeking answers, have lost your way, or need advice.
    
- **Puss in Boots:** Smart and smart-alecky, Puss in Boots always has a plan in motion, and at least two others that are about to begin.
    

Bagheera

 

level 7; stalking, hunting, sneaking, and chasing prey as level 8; persuasion and positive social interactions as level 8; inflicts 6 points of damage with teeth and claws; can pounce on a victim from a long distance away to inflict 7 points of damage and knock the victim prone.

Beast (with a capital B)

 

level 6; intimidation and protection as level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4 points of damage with an item related to their beloved (gardening shears, for example).

Cheshire Cat

 

level 6; punning and wordplay as level 7, Speed defense as level 8 due to intangibility; will disappear rather than fight.

Puss in Boots

 

level 5; planning, scheming, persuasion, and deception as level 7; Armor 2; inflicts 4 points of damage with elaborate swordplay.

- Animals, normal (314)
- Black Dog (WAAMH, 107)
- Cat sidhe (WAAMH, 108)

- Toby the turtle (WAAMH, 186)
- Wolf, Big Bad (WAAMH, 111)

### CRAFTED

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 102)

Crafted creatures are those made by human, fey, or other hands. In fairy tales these might include characters like Pinocchio, the Iron Giant, Edward Scissorhands, the Gingerbread Man, and the Tin Man.

#### TALKING OBJECTS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 105)

If you have a talking object in your game, it has a level (just like creatures and regular objects), and every interaction with it is based on that level. Its level can be based on its physical and mental complexity as well as its purpose. So something like a singing teapot might be level 2 with 2 Armor, and it can hurl its lid at a foe to inflict 2 points of damage. A complicated talking lock who guards a precious treasure might be level 5 or 6 and can cast a spell (inflicting 3 points of damage) on anyone who tries to pick it.

Some abilities in the game work only on objects, or only on creatures, or only on living things. A talking object might or might not be living, depending on its nature.

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 112)

- **Gingerbread Creatures:** Gingerbread creatures can take any shape and form, but are most often humans, dogs, or dragons. Typically crafted and brought to life by witches and enchanters, gingerbread creatures tend to remain loyal to their creators, even if they are treated poorly.
    
- **Geppetto's Children:** Made of wood and wishes, Geppetto's children are everywhere in the world. They go through a number of life stages, starting as wooden puppets and eventually becoming real humans. No matter what stage they're in, they're nonstop sources of destruction and chaos.
    
- **Virgilius's Copper Dogs:** Once the loyal companions of Virgilius the Sorcerer, this pack of dogs now runs feral. Despite being created through the power of magic, they despise anything that stinks of magic and attempt to bring it down.
    

Gingerbread Creatures

 

Level 2, Speed defense as level 4 due to quickness; when touched or eaten, some gingerbread creatures release a sweet, slow poison that inflicts 1 point of damage each round for 1d6 rounds.

Geppetto's Children

 

level 4; Armor 1; have a passion for creating, collecting, and using cyphers, particularly detonation cyphers

Virgilius's Copper Dogs

 

level 5; Armor 2

- Golem (336)
- Horse head automatons (WAAMH, 156)
- Tin Woodman (WAAMH, 113)

### EARTH BEINGS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 102)

Creatures of the earth are those that seem to belong to the land in some unique and significant way. Perhaps they are made of the land and its offerings—tree beings, rock trolls, and so on—or perhaps they seem attached to the land in important ways, such as the way in which the minotaur is part of its maze or the way that dwarves have a unique connection to mountains.

Dwarf

 

level 4; Armor 2; mining pick inflicts 4 points of damage; beards provide magical abilities such as finding treasure, enabling flight, shapeshifting, and turning invisible. Cutting a dwarf's beard off or learning their name provides an asset on all interactions with that dwarf.

- Erlking (WAAMH, 116)
- Giant (333)
- Goblin (335)
- Golem (336)
- Minotaur, the (WAAMH, 117)
- Ogre (346)
- Sapient Tree (GF, 124)
- Satyr (GF, 125)
- Troll (GF, 129)

### FEY BEINGS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 102)

In fairy tales, the word fey covers a huge category of creatures, from faeries, brownies, and imps to gremlins, boggarts, and goblins. There are so many types of fey beings in the world that it's nearly impossible to categorize them as just one thing, or to list them all. They do have a few characteristics in common, however. They are typically sentient, humanoid in form, connected to nature in some way, and magical.

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 121)

- **Angiks:** Reanimated spirits of babies who died, typically due to hard winters, and who now haunt the living. At night, they turn into giant owls and prey on solitary travelers.
    
- **Changelings:** Fairy children left in place of stolen human babies (and occasionally adults as well), typically raised among humans.
    
- **Nymphs:** Supernatural beings (often female) associated with protecting a particular location or landform, such as a river, tree, or mountain.
    
- **Pixies:** Benign and mischievous creatures that live near stone circles, tombs, and other burial grounds.
    

Angiks

 

level 3; talons inflict 4 points of damage

Changelings

 

level 2; shapeshifting and knowledge of the fey world as level 4

Nymphs

 

level 3; stealth and positive social interactions as level 6

Pixies

 

level 2; stealth and finding lost items as level 6

- Áine, Fairy Queen of Light and Love(WAAMH, 124)
- Brownie (WAAMH, 145)
- Cailleach (WAAMH, 129)
- Cat sidhe (WAAMH, 108)
- Enchanted moura (WAAMH, 192)
- Erlking (WAAMH, 116)
- Fairy godmother (WAAMH, 123)
- Gráinne, the Wayward Daughter (WAAMH, 125)
- Headless horse (WAAMH, 188)
- Nightmare (WAAMH, 188)
- Prince(ss) of summer (348)
- Satyr (GF, 125)
- Tink (WAAMH, 185)
- Tunnel bog (WAAMH, 145)
- Will-o-wisp (WAAMH, 155)

### OF THE GRAVE

- Demigod (321)
- Demon (322)
- Devil (323)
- Djinni (324)
- Fallen Angel (329)
- Ghost (331)
- Ghoul (332)
- Skeleton (353)

### HUMAN NPCS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 136)

The NPCs in the following section are general examples of nonmagical, mortal human characters that are commonly found in fairy tales.

**From General to Specific:** While the NPCs listed here are general types, such as crafter and robber, it's easy to turn them into specific characters from common and well-known fairy tales. For example, with a little tweaking, you can turn a generic tailor into the tailor from The Brave Little Tailor. Just give the crafter NPC a banner that says "SEVEN WITH ONE BLOW" and embrace a jaunty, overconfident nature, and you have the titular character.

**Naming Your NPCs:** You might have noticed that in fairy tales, many characters —especially those of the lower or working classes—don't have a name beyond their title, position, or profession (or sometimes their marriage status). "The Woodcutter," "the Tailor," "the Baker's wife," and so on. While you could follow suit and just call your NPC "the Woodcutter," most player characters are going to ask that person their name. It's likely to break immersion if you throw in a modern name, or if the NPC tries to explain that they don't have one, they're just called "the Woodcutter." And if you call them all Jack, then no one (including you) will remember which one is which. Consider coming up with a list of names ahead of time so that you're always ready to give players something to call a new walk-on character.

- Aristocrat (WAAMH, 137)
- Child (WAAMH, 138)
- Crafter (WAAMH, 138)
- Huntsman/Woodcutter (WAAMH, 139)
- Robber (WAAMH, 139)
- Thief (GF, 137)
- Scholar (WAAMH, 140)

### NAMED CHARACTERS

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 102)

- Happy (WAAMH, 186)
- Humpty Dumpty (WAAMH, 185)
- Maid Maleen (WAAMH, 186)
- Snow White (WAAMH, 185)
- Toby the turtle (WAAMH, 186)

### ROYALTY

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 103)

Creatures of water and waves are those that inhabit or are deeply tied to the rivers, ocean, marshes, and other watery areas of the world.

(WE ARE ALL MAD HERE, PAGE 128)

- **Drowning Fairies:** There are many types of creatures known as "drowning fairies," including Peg Powler, the Water Leaper, Fossegrim, and Jenny Greenteeth. These creatures typically dwell below or next to water and tempt, pull, or trick passersby into the water.
    
- **Fuath:** Fuathan are intangible spirits that dwell deep in the seas and oceans. They consider themselves protectors of these realms, particularly against fishermen and others who would damage the environment or creatures there. Fuathan have the power to make themselves visible, most often taking the form of humanoid creatures with green skin and the flowing mane and tail of a golden horse.
    
- **Naiad:** These water nymphs inhabit rivers, springs, waterfalls, and other bodies of fresh water. Typically appearing as beautiful young women with long limbs and flowing hair, naiads are considered protectors, for they guard their land fiercely. However, they are easily provoked and their wrath is fierce.
