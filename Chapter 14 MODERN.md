(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 261)

The modern setting is easy because it's just the real world, right? Well, yes and no. It's easy for players to understand the context of a modern setting. They know the default assumptions—cities, cars, cell phones, the internet, and so on. It's also easier for some players to get into character, because their character could be someone they might very well pass on the street. It can be easier to wrap your mind around a history professor than a thousand-year-old elf wizard. These things make it easier on the GM as well.

But for the same reason, it's not easy. The setting is the real world we all know, so it's easy to get facts wrong or let them bog you down. What happens when you pull the fire alarm on the thirty-fifth floor of a major hotel in a large city? How fast do the authorities arrive? In truth, the facts aren't as important as the story you're creating, but some verisimilitude is nice.

## MOLDING CHARACTERS FOR A MODERN GAME

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 262)

If you're trying to portray a psychic with a few basic powers, you might not want to use the Adept character type. Instead, choose a different type (perhaps a Speaker) and encourage foci such as Commands Mental Powers or Focuses Mind Over Matter. Some of the Adept's powers might be too over the top for the genre.

Similarly, the technology flavor is probably too high-tech for a modern game. For someone with technical skills, use the skills and knowledge flavor instead.

Sometimes, the types might be more physical than is always desirable for a modern game, but that's because the least physical type, the Adept, is often inappropriate for other reasons. The Calm descriptor is very good for such characters, not only granting them a great deal of skill and knowledge, but also reducing their physical capabilities.

Last, don't forget foci such as Doesn't Do Much or Would Rather Be Reading for "normal" characters who have useful skills but not much in the way of flashy abilities.

Interpreting Mundane Foci

|Is Licensed to Carry|Before the advent of firearms in the 14th century, this focus can work for archers, crossbow-wielders, or someone particularly adept with a sling.|
|Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger|This focus can be made to work for any criminal, paramilitary, black ops, or terrorist organization with a fearsome reputation.|
|Works the System|Starting around 1965, "phone phreaking" or other forms of hacking and electronic forgery might be a valuable ability.|

## OPTIONAL RULE: HANDLING PCS AS CHILDREN

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 266)

The regular character creation process makes fully competent, adult characters. To account for playing children, the GM could adopt this optional rule. First, the players make their characters normally, and then they apply the following adjustments to their PCs, as appropriate to their age category. You might also consider applying a tier cap of 3 to childhood adventure games with kids of up to thirteen years old, and a tier cap of 4 for childhood adventure games featuring PCs who are aged fourteen to seventeen.

### AGE 9 TO 13

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 266)

- **Slight:** −4 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Vulnerable:** Adults look out for you. You are trained in all pleasant social interactions with adults.
    
- **Inability:** Might-based tasks are hindered.
    
- **Inability:** Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.
    

### AGE 14 TO 17

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 266)

- **Youthful:** −2 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Inability:** Tasks involving knowledge are hindered.

In a modern setting, the following items (and anything else appropriate to the real world) are usually available.

**Editor's Notes —** Equipment might range in price and quality.

### CONTEMPORARY RECREATION

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 82)

Occasional recreation is absolutely necessary to maintain stable relationships as well as mental stability and happiness. Characters that never engage in recreation become gradually more unhappy and troubled, and eventually find interaction tasks and most Intellect tasks hindered unexpectedly.

#### ALCOHOL/DRUGS2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 82)

- **Price:** Inexpensive/Moderate/Expensive
    
- **Effect:** Common intoxicants taken in moderation can raise spirits, easing tasks related to social interaction while at the same time hindering tasks related to perception and physical coordination. Excessive amounts cancel out the benefit to social interaction and hinder all tasks by two or more steps, making even routine tasks a challenge. Extended excessive use can lead to addiction, a long-term disease difficult to recover from.
    
    Other kinds of drugs have a different ease and hinder profile. For example, the dose of caffeine in a cup of coffee can ease tasks related to concentration and motivation but hinder tasks related to resisting anxiety and irritability. On the other hand, addiction to caffeine normally isn't nearly as serious an addiction as alcohol or opioids.

#### CAR, UTILITY4 (12)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 97)

- **Price:** Expensive to Very Expensive
    
- **Details:** Four-wheeled vehicle, supporting a frame in a van or truck configuration that prioritizes carrying cargo over passengers (though up to ten additional passengers, in addition to the driver, could squeeze into a van or into the open bed of truck). Operable/easily breakable glass windows (and/or retractable hardtop) provide openness to environment. Moves a long distance each round on paved surfaces or an average of 96 km/h (60 mph) during extended trips.
    

### CONTEMPORARY AIRCRAFT

#### AIRPLANE, BASIC2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 98)

Features both open decks and a couple of completely enclosed interior chambers. A gunboat is cramped, has little room for food or water, and is not as seaworthy as it could be (all tasks related to operating the craft, except vehicular combat, are hindered). Moves a long distance each round or up to 96 km/h (60 mph) on calm water (half movement rates in choppy water). Requires a trained crew and central coordination to operate.

### CONTEMPORARY SPACECRAFT

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 107)

Though extremely complex, pioneer-era spacecraft are not robust vehicles. Technology allowing re-use of components is still in its infancy in these contemporary tech spacecraft, and small problems have a way of becoming major catastrophes if not caught and quickly dealt with.

In fact, that very complexity exacts a toll. Generally speaking, all tasks for operating a pioneer-era spacecraft are hindered by two steps. Only the very well trained (or the very lucky) should even consider trying to operate such a craft. Finally, pioneer-era spacecraft usually don't have weapon systems.

#### ROCKET, HEAVY-LIFT LAUNCH2 (6)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 107)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** Provides access to low orbit and beyond for a cargo of up to 45,350 kg (100,000 pounds) through the coordinated efforts of dozens of engineers and controllers operating and monitoring the vehicle from another location. Extremely limited maneuverability; a detachable space capsule allows for transfer of crew or cargo to orbiting craft or stations from the launch vehicle after ascent. Craft is partially re-usable in that the booster rockets autonomously return to designated pads where they can be refurbished and refueled.
    

#### SHUTTLE, LAUNCH3 (9)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 107)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** As heavy-lift launch vehicle, except the main craft can re-enter an atmosphere after delivering a payload and land aerodynamically as a fixed wing craft. Much greater maneuverability than a launch vehicle, both in space and in the air on re-entry, though all piloting tasks are hindered. Refurbishment means essentially rebuilding the spacecraft, and is a process of many months and another priceless expenditure in cost.
    

#### SPACE CAPSULE1 (3)

(THE STARS ARE FIRE, PAGE 107)

- **Price:** Priceless
    
- **Details:** Sealed capsule delivered into space by a launch vehicle or shuttle, carries a crew of up to seven or a payload of up to 6,000 kg (13,000 pounds); once delivered into a microgravity environment, becomes a free-flying spacecraft with limited maneuverability, though all piloting tasks are hindered and propellant must be renewed every ten hours of use. Capable of safely returning crew and cargo back down a gravity well though a fiery reentry process that lands the capsule in water for recovery by watercraft.
