**Editor's Notes —** Chapter 25: : Running the Game of the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/) features a wealth of guidance on many subjects not included in the CSRD. A list of these sections is detailed in Cypher System Rulebook — What's in the Book?.

Additionally, this blog post on [Keeping to the Theme](https://montecook.substack.com/p/keeping-to-the-theme) by Monte Cook offers some excellent advice that is applicable to the Cypher System: when you're not sure how proceed, reflect the genre(s) that inform your game and ask yourself: what happens in stories like these? What kind of behaviors will changes to the rules encourage or reward? This kind of reflection is useful to help decide on the use of optional rules or other changes to the game, and also when making decisions and rulings during a session.

## TYING ACTIONS TO STATS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 416)

Although the decision is open to your discretion, when a PC takes an action, it should be fairly obvious which stat is tied to that action.

- **Might:** Physical actions that involve brute force or endurance use Might.
    
- **Speed:** Physical actions that involve quickness, coordination, or agility use Speed.
    

- **Intellect:** Actions that involve intelligence, education, insight, willpower, or charm use Intellect.
    

In rare instances, you could allow a PC to use a different stat for a task. For example, a character might try to break down a door by examining it closely for flaws and thus use Intellect rather than Might. This kind of change is a good thing because it encourages player creativity. Just don't let it be abused by an exuberant or too-clever player. It's well within your purview to decide that the door has no flaws, or to rule that the character's attempt will take half an hour rather than one round. In other words, using a stat that is not the obvious choice should be the exception, not the rule.

## SETTING DIFFICULTY RATINGS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 403)

The GM's most important overall tasks are setting the stage and guiding the story created by the group (not the one created by the GM ahead of time). But setting difficulty is the most important mechanical task the GM has in the game. Although there are suggestions throughout this chapter for various difficulty ratings for certain actions, there is no master list of the difficulty for every action a PC can take. Instead, the Cypher System is designed with the "teach a person to fish" style of good game mastering in mind. (If you don't know what that means, it comes from the old adage "Give a person a fish and they'll eat for a day. Teach a person to fish and they'll eat for a lifetime." The idea is not to give GMs a ton of rules to memorize or reference, but to teach them how to make their own logical judgment calls.) Of course, most of the time, it's not a matter of exact precision. If you say the difficulty is 3 and it "should" have been 4, the world's not over.

For the most part, it really is as simple as rating something on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being incredibly easy and 10 being basically impossible. The guidelines in the Task Difficulty table should help put you in the right frame of mind for assigning difficulty to a task.

### TASK DIFFICULTY

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 404)

Task Difficulty

|Task Difficulty|Target Number|Task Success Rate|Description|Guidance|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|(0)|100%|Routine|Anyone can do this basically every time.|
|1|(3)|90%|Simple|Most people can do this most of the time.|
|2|(6)|75%|Standard|Typical task requiring focus, but most people can usually do this.|
|3|(9)|60%|Demanding|Requires full attention; most people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.|
|4|(12)|45%|Difficult|Trained people have a 50/50 chance to succeed.|
|5|(15)|30%|Challenging|Even trained people often fail.|
|6|(18)|15%|Intimidating|Normal people almost never succeed.|
|7|(21)|—|Formidable|Impossible without skills or great effort.|
|8|(24)|−15%|Heroic|A task worthy of tales told for years afterward.|
|9|(27)|−30%|Immortal|A task worthy of legends that last lifetimes.|
|10|(30)|−45%|Impossible|A task that normal humans couldn't consider (but one that doesn't break the laws of physics).|

**Editor's Notes —** This table has been amended by the editor to include task success rates as a percentage.

For example, we make the distinction between something that most people can do and something that trained people can do. In this case, "normal" means someone with absolutely no training, talent, or experience—imagine your ne'er-do-well, slightly overweight uncle trying a task he's never tried before. "Trained" means the person has some level of instruction or experience but is not necessarily a professional.

With that in mind, think about the act of balance. With enough focus, most people can walk across a narrow bridge (like a fallen tree trunk). That suggests it is difficulty 2. However, walking across a narrow plank that's only 3 inches (8 cm) wide? That's probably more like difficulty 3. Now consider walking across a tightrope. That's probably difficulty 5—a normal person can manage that only with a great deal of luck. Someone with some training can give it a go, but it's still hard. Of course, a professional acrobat can do it easily. Consider, however, that the professional acrobat is specialized in the task, making it difficulty 3 for them. They probably are using Effort as well during their performance.

Let's try another task. This time, consider how hard it might be to remember the name of the previous leader of the village where the character lives. The difficulty might be 0 or 1, depending on how long ago they were the leader and how well known they were. Let's say it was thirty years ago and they were only mildly memorable, so it's difficulty 1. Most people remember them, and with a little bit of effort, anyone can come up with their name. Now let's consider the name of the leader's daughter. That's much harder. Assuming the daughter wasn't famous in her own right, it's probably difficulty 4. Even people who know a little about local history (that is to say, people who are trained in the subject) might not be able to remember it. But what about the name of the pet dog owned by the daughter's spouse? That's probably impossible. Who's going to remember the name of an obscure person's pet from thirty years ago? Basically no one. However, it's not forbidden knowledge or a well-guarded secret, so it sounds like difficulty 7. Difficulty 7 is the rating that means "No one can do this, yet some people still do." It's not the stuff of legend, but it's something you would assume people can't do. When you think there's no way you can get tickets for a sold-out concert, but somehow your friend manages to score a couple anyway, that's difficulty 7. (See the next section for more on difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10.)

If you're talking about a task, ideally the difficulty shouldn't be based on the character performing the task. Things don't get inherently easier or harder depending on who is doing them. However, the truth is, the character does play into it as a judgment call. If the task is breaking down a wooden door, an 8-foot-tall (2 m) automaton made of metal with nuclear-driven motors should be better at breaking it down than an average human would be, but the task rating should be the same for both. Let's say that the automaton's nature effectively gives it two levels of training in such tasks. Thus, if the door has a difficulty rating of 4, but the automaton is specialized and reduces the difficulty to 2, it has a target number of 6. The human has no such specialization, so the difficulty remains 4, and the person has a target number of 12. However, when you set the difficulty of breaking down the door, don't try to take all those differences into account. The GM should consider only the human because the Task Difficulty table is based on the ideal of a "normal" person, a "trained" person, and so on. It's humanocentric.

Most characters probably are willing to use one or two levels of Effort on a task, and they might have an appropriate skill or asset to decrease the difficulty by a step. That means that a difficulty 4 task will often be treated as difficulty 2 or even 1, and those are easy rolls to make. Don't hesitate, then, to pull out higher-level difficulties. The PCs can rise to the challenge, especially if they are experienced.

### THE IMPOSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 404)

Difficulties 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all technically impossible. Their target numbers are 21, 24, 27, and 30, and you can't roll those numbers on a d20 no matter how many times you try. Consider, however, all the ways that a character can reduce difficulty. If someone spends a little Effort or has some skill or help, it brings difficulty 7 (target number 21) into the range of possibility—difficulty 6 (target number 18). Now consider that they have specialization, use a lot of Effort, and have help. That might bring the difficulty down to 1 or even 0 (reducing it by two steps from training and specialization, three or four steps from Effort, and one step from the asset of assistance). That practically impossible task just became routine. A fourth-tier character can and will do this—not every time, due to the cost, but perhaps once per game session. You have to be ready for that. A well-prepared, motivated sixth-tier character can do that even with a difficulty 10 task. Again, they won't do it often (they'd have to apply six levels of Effort, and even with an Edge of 6 that would cost 7 points from their Pool, and that's assuming they're specialized and have two levels of assets), but it can happen if they're really prepared for the task (being specialized and maxed out in asset opportunities reduces the difficulty by four more steps). That's why sixth-tier characters are at the top of their field, so to speak.

**Editor's Notes —** Challenging PCs with power shifts might require task difficulties as high as 15. See Really Impossible Tasks for some examples.

### FALSE PRECISION

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 405)

One way to look at difficulty is that each step of difficulty is worth 3 on the die. That is to say, hinder the task by one step, and the target number rises by 3. Ease the task by one step, and the target number is lowered by 3. Those kinds of changes are big, meaty chunks. Difficulty, as a game mechanic, is not terribly precise. It's measured in large portions. You never have a target number of 13 or 14, for example—it's always 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on. (Technically, this is not true. If a character adds 1 to a d20 roll for some reason, it changes a target number of 15 to 14. But this is not worth much discussion.)

Imprecision is good in this case. It would be false precision to say that one lock has a target number of 14 and another has a target number of 15. What false precision means in this context is that it would be a delusion to think we can be that exact. Can you really say that one lock is 5% easier to pick than another? And more important, even if you could, is the difference worth noting? It's better to interact with the world in larger, more meaningful chunks than to try to parse things so carefully. If we tried to rate everything on a scale of 1 to 30 (using target numbers and not difficulty), we'd start to get lost in the proverbial weeds coming up with a meaningful distinction between something rated as an 8 and something rated as a 9 on that scale.

### ROUTINE ACTIONS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 406)

Don't hesitate to make actions routine. Don't call for die rolls when they're not really needed. Sometimes GMs fall into the trap illustrated by this dialogue:

**GM:** What do you do?

**Player:** I _________.

**GM:** Okay, give me a roll.

That's not a good instinct—at least, not for the Cypher System. Players should roll when it's interesting or exciting. Otherwise, they should just do what they do. If the PCs tie a rope around something and use it to climb down into a pit, you could ask for tying rolls, climbing rolls, and so on, but why? Just to see if they roll terribly? So the rope can come undone at the wrong time, or a character's hand can slip? Most of the time, that makes players feel inadequate and isn't a lot of fun. A rope coming undone in the middle of an exciting chase scene or a battle can be a great complication (and that's what GM intrusions are for). A rope coming undone in the middle of a simple "getting from point A to point B" scene only slows down gameplay. The real fun—the real story—is down in the pit. So get the PCs down there.

There are a million exceptions to this guideline, of course. If creatures are throwing poisoned darts at the PCs while they climb, that might make things more interesting and require a roll. If the pit is filled with acid and the PCs must climb halfway down, pull a lever, and come back up, that's a situation where you should set difficulty and perhaps have a roll. If a PC is near death, carrying a fragile item of great importance, or something similar, climbing down the rope is tense, and a roll might add to the excitement. The important difference is that these kinds of complications have real consequences.

On the flip side, don't be afraid to use GM intrusion on routine actions if it makes things more interesting. Walking up to the king in his audience chamber in the middle of a ceremony only to trip on a rug? That could have huge ramifications for the character and the story.

### OTHER WAYS TO JUDGE DIFFICULTY

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 407)

Rating things on a scale of 1 to 10 is something that most people are very familiar with. You can also look at it as rating an object or creature on a similar scale, if that's easier. In other words, if you don't know how hard it would be to climb a particular cliff face, think of it as a creature the PCs have to fight. What level would the creature be? You could look in Chapter 22: : Creatures and say "I think this wall should be about as difficult to deal with as a demon. A demon is level 5, so the task of climbing the wall will be difficulty 5." That's a weird way to do it, perhaps, but it's fairly straightforward. And if you're the kind of GM who thinks in terms of "How tough will this fight be?" then maybe rating tasks as creatures or NPCs to fight isn't so strange after all. It's just another way to relate to them. The important thing is that they're on the same scale. Similarly, if the PCs have to tackle a knowledge task—say, trying to determine if they know where a caravan is headed based on its tracks—you could rate the task in terms of an object. If you're used to rating doors or other objects that the PCs have broken through recently, the knowledge task is just a different kind of barrier to bust through.

Everything in the Cypher System—characters, creatures, objects, tasks, and so on—has a level. It might be called a tier or a difficulty instead of a level, but ultimately it's a numerical rating system used to compare things. Although you have to be careful about drawing too many correlations—a first-tier character isn't easily compared to a difficulty 1 wall or a level 1 animal—the principle is the same. Everything can be rated and roughly compared to everything else in the world. (It works best to take PCs out of this equation. For example, you shouldn't try to compare a PC's tier to a wall's level. Character tiers are mentioned here only for completeness.)

Last, if your mind leans toward statistics, you can look at difficulty as a percentage chance. Every number on the d20 is a 5% increment. For example, you have a 5% chance of rolling a 1. You have a 10% chance of rolling a 1 or a 2. Thus, if you need to roll a 12 or higher, you have a 45% chance of success. (A d20 has nine numbers that are 12 or higher: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. And 9 × 5 equals 45.)

For some people, it's easier to think in terms of a percentage chance. A GM might think "She has about a 30% chance to know that fact about geography." Each number on a d20 is a 5% increment, and it takes six increments to equal 30%, so there are six numbers that mean the PC succeeds: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Thus, since the player has to roll 15 or higher, that means the target number is 15. (And that means the task is level 5, but if you've already determined the target number, you likely don't care about the level.)

**Editor's Notes —** The Difficulty Dial presented in Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game provides a visual representation of difficulties, target numbers, and percentage chance of success.

### ADVANTAGES TO THIS SYSTEM

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 407)

1. The GM makes measured adjustments in large, uniform steps. That makes things faster than if players had to do arithmetic using a range of all numbers from 1 to 20.
    
2. You calculate a target number only once no matter how many times the PCs attempt the action. If you establish that the target number is 12, it's 12 every time a PC tries that action. (On the other hand, if you had to add numbers to your die roll, you'd have to do it for every attempt.) Consider this fact in light of combat. Once a player knows that they need to roll a 12 or higher to hit a foe, combat moves very quickly.
    
3. If a PC can reduce the difficulty of an action to 0, no roll is needed. This means that an Olympic gymnast doesn't roll a die to walk across a balance beam, but the average person does. The task is initially rated the same for both, but the difficulty is reduced for the gymnast. There's no chance of failure.
    
4. This is how everything in the game works, whether it's climbing a wall, sweet-talking a guard, or fighting a bioengineered horror.
    
5. Perhaps most important, the system gives GMs the freedom to focus entirely on the flow of the game. The GM doesn't use dice to determine what happens (unless you want to)—the players do. There aren't a lot of different rules for different actions, so there is little to remember and very little to reference. The difficulty can be used as a narrative tool, with the challenges always meeting the expected logic of the game. All the GM's mental space can be devoted to guiding the story.
    

### VAGUE DIFFICULTY

_The section has been added by the editor._

---

When players are new to the game, it is a good idea to tell them the difficulty of the task ahead. Doing so lets them make informed decisions about whether or not to use Effort to ease a task.

This table can be used when a GM wants to withhold exact difficulty, for example, in a situation perhaps the players don't know what they are doing, or are not in the position to fully understand the circumstances—or witness the results—of their attempted task. In such instances, the GM can provide a vague sense of how difficult the PC _believes_ the task will be.

Vague Difficulty

|Difficulty|Vague Description|
|---|---|
|0|Routine (succeeds with no roll required)|
|1–2|Easy|
|3–4|Average|
|5–6|Difficult|
|7–10|Impossible (only those with skills, assets, or who use Effort will succeed)|
|11–15|Really Impossible (only high-tier characters, those with cyphers that ease tasks, or power shifts will succeed, and even that might require some luck)|

---

### GRADUATED DIFFICULTY

_The section is based on Graduated Success (417) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

In other instances, the GM might not assign a difficulty at all, and simply ask for a roll. This is useful for tasks related to perception, social interaction, sensing motives, understanding, identifying, or remembering. These tasks might allow for different outcomes at several difficulties, and so might benefit from lacking an assigned numerical difficulty. With each additional difficulty the roll succeeds against, the GM might provide additional relevant information or appropriate other benefits.

---

### PASSIVE DIFFICULTY

_The section is based on The Flow of Information (416) and Failure to Notice (417) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

Because the player always rolls, it can be unclear how the GM should proceed if the PCs are unaware of important aspects of their situation. The GM can prompt a PC for a roll without telling them anything about what it's for, but this might arouse unwanted suspicion. Instead, the GM can compare the PC's tier to the difficulty of the task, and add 1 for each of the PC's applicable skills and assets. Any ties are decided in the PC's favor.

For example, a tier 3 PC is specialized in tracking and has a Beast Companion—a faithful bloodhound, whose modification that provides an asset to tracking tasks. This make's the PC's passive total 3 (tier) plus 2 (skills) plus 1 (asset) equals 6. So, the PC would detect the presence of a dangerous level 6 creature before it pounced upon a fellow party member—as almost a passive routine action.

Passive difficulty provides the GM with a way to think about providing directly to PCs' unique senses, knowledges, abilities, skills, and personal pasts—honoring of all the choices the player made whilst creating their character, and since the start of the game. The GM should strive to be generous with information—after all, information and answers are two very different things, and a well-informed party can make more compelling choices about what they do next. Events like ambushes, or a PC discovering they have been pickpocketed can easily be introduced via GM intrusion, so it's best to describe the situation in a way that invites further action from the PCs rather than withhold critical information.

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 408)

GM intrusion is the main mechanic that the GM uses to inject drama and additional excitement into the game. It's also a handy tool for resolving issues that affect the PCs but do not involve them. GM intrusion is a way to facilitate what goes on in the world outside the characters. Can the minotaur track the PCs' movements through the maze? Will the fraying rope hold?

Since the players roll all the dice, GM intrusion is used to determine if and when something happens. For example, if the PCs are fighting a noble's guards, and you (the GM) know that there are more guards nearby, you don't need to roll dice to determine if the other guards hear the scuffle and intervene (unless you want to). You just decide when it would be best for the story—which is probably when it would be worst for the characters. In a way, GM intrusion replaces the GM's die rolling.

The mechanic is also one of the main ways that GMs award experience points to the PCs. This means that you use experience points as a narrative tool. Whenever it seems appropriate, you can introduce complications into the game that affect a specific player, but when you do so, you give that player 1 XP. The player can refuse the intrusion, but doing so costs them 1 XP. So by refusing an intrusion, the player does not get the experience point that the GM is offering, and they lose one that they already have. (This kind of refusal is likely to happen very rarely in your game, if ever. And, obviously, a player can't refuse an intrusion if they have no XP to spend.)

Here's how a GM intrusion might work in play. Say the PCs find a hidden console with some buttons. They learn the right order in which to press the buttons, and a section of the floor disappears. As the GM, you don't ask the players specifically where their characters are standing. Instead, you give a player 1 XP and say "Unfortunately, you're standing directly over this new hole in the floor." If the player wanted, they could refuse the XP, spend one of their own, and say "I leap aside to safety." Most likely, though, they'll make the defense roll that you call for and let it play out.

There are two ways for the GM to handle this kind of intrusion. You could say "You're standing in the wrong place, so make a roll." (It's a Speed defense roll, of course.) Alternatively, you could say "You're standing in the wrong place. The floor opens under your feet, and you fall down into the darkness." In the first example, the PC has a chance to save themselves. In the second example, they don't. Both are viable options. The distinction is based on any number of factors, including the situation, the characters involved, and the needs of the story. This might seem arbitrary or even capricious, but you're the master of what the intrusion can and can't do. RPG mechanics need consistency so players can make intelligent decisions based on how they understand the world to work. But they'll never base their decisions on GM intrusions. They don't know when intrusions will happen or what form they will take. GM intrusions are the unpredictable and strange twists of fate that affect a person's life every day.

When player modifications (such as skill, Effort, and so on) determine that success is automatic, the GM can use GM intrusion to negate the automatic success. The player must roll for the action at its original difficulty level or target number 20, whichever is lower.

Remember, any time you give a player 1 XP for a GM intrusion, you're actually giving them 2— one to keep and one to give to another player.

### USING GM INTRUSION AS A NARRATIVE TOOL

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 408)

A GM can use this narrative tool to steer things. That doesn't mean railroad the players or direct the action of the game with a heavy hand. GM intrusion doesn't enable you to say "You're all captured, so here's your 1 XP." Instead, the GM can direct things more subtly—gently, almost imperceptibly influencing events rather than forcing them. GM intrusion represents things going wrong. The bad guys planning well. Fortune not favoring the characters.

Consider this scenario: the GM plants an interesting adventure seed in a small village, but the PCs don't stay there long enough to find it. So just outside the village, the PCs run afoul of a vicious viper that bites one of them. The GM uses intrusion to say that the poison from the snake will make the character debilitated unless they get a large dose of a specific antitoxin, which the group doesn't have. Of course, they aren't required to go back to the village where the GM's interesting adventure can start, but it's likely that they will, looking for the antitoxin.

Some players might find intrusion heavy-handed, but the XP softens the blow. And remember, they can refuse these narrative nudges. Intrusion is not meant to be a railroading tool—just a bit of a rudder. Not an inescapable track, but a nudge here and there.

What's more, the GM doesn't need to have a deliberate goal in mind. The complication you introduce could simply make things more interesting. You might not know where it will take the story, just that it will make the story better.

This is wonderfully empowering to the GM—not in a "Ha ha, now I'll trounce the PCs" way, but in an "I can control the narrative a little bit, steering it more toward the story I want to create rather than relying on the dice" sort of way. Consider that old classic plot development in which the PCs get captured and must escape from the bad guys. In heroic fiction, this is such a staple that it would almost seem strange if it didn't happen. But in many roleplaying games, it's a nearly impossible turn of events—the PCs usually have too many ways to get out of the bad guy's clutches before they're captured. The dice have to be wildly against them. It virtually never happens. With GM intrusion, it could happen (again, in the context of the larger encounter, not as a single intrusion that results in the entire group of PCs being captured with little explanation or chance to react).

For example, let's say the PCs are surrounded by orcs. One character is badly injured—debilitated—and the rest are hurt. Some of the orcs produce a large weighted net. Rather than asking for a lot of rolls and figuring the mechanics for escape, you use intrusion and say that the net goes over the PCs who are still on their feet. The rest of the orcs point spears menacingly. This is a pretty strong cue to the players that surrender is a good (and possibly the only) option. Some players won't take the hint, however, so another use of intrusion might allow the orcs to hit one of the trapped PCs on the head and render them unconscious while their friends struggle in the net. If the players still don't surrender, it's probably best to play out the rest of the encounter without more GM intrusions—using more would be heavy-handed by anyone's measure—although it's perfectly reasonable to rule that a character rendered debilitated is knocked unconscious, since the orcs are trying to take the PCs alive.

Remember that GM intrusions can occur at any time, not just during combat. Disrupting or changing a tense interaction with NPCs can have big repercussions.

### USING GM INTRUSION AS A RESOLUTION MECHANIC

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 409)

This mechanic offers a way for the GM to determine how things happen in the game without leaving it all to random chance. Bad guys trying to smash down the door to the room where the PCs are holed up? You could roll a bunch of dice, compare the NPCs' stats to the door's stats, and so on, or you could wait until the most interesting time, have the bad guys break in, and award an experience point to the PC who tried their best to bar the door. The latter way is the Cypher System way. Intrusion is a task resolution tool for the GM. In other words, you don't base things on stats but on narrative choice. (Frankly, a lot of great GMs over the years—even in the very early days of the hobby—have run their games this way. Sometimes they rolled dice or pretended to roll dice, but they were really manipulating things.) This method frees the GM from worrying about mechanics and looking up stats and allows them to focus on the story.

This isn't cheating—it's the rules of the game. This rule simply replaces traditional dice rolling with good game mastering, logic, and intelligent storytelling. When a PC is climbing a burning rope, and everyone knows that it will break at some point, the game has a mechanism to ensure that it breaks at just the right time.

- **Variant:** If you want more randomness in your game, or if you want your game to seem like more of a simulation, assign a flat percentage chance for whatever you're trying to resolve. For example, each round, the star troopers have a 20% chance to blast through the door—or, if you want the risk to escalate, a cumulative 20% chance to blast through the door. By not using GM intrusion, this method robs the PCs of a few XP, but when they see you rolling dice, it might help with their immersion. Alternatively, you can pretend to roll dice but really use GM intrusion, though this method seriously robs the characters of XP.
    

There's a better way. Announce your intrusion, but say that there's only a chance it will happen (state the percentage chance), and then roll the dice in plain view of everyone. If the intrusion occurs, award the XP as normal. This is likely the best of both worlds. However, it takes the narrative power out of your hands and gives it to the dice. Perhaps this method is best used only occasionally. If nothing else, it injects some variety and certainly some drama.

### USING (AND NOT ABUSING) GM INTRUSION

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 410)

Too much of a good thing will make the game seem utterly unpredictable—even capricious. The ideal is to use about four GM intrusions per game session, depending on the length of the session, or about one intrusion per hour of game play. This is in addition to any intrusions that are triggered by players rolling a 1.

### INTRUSION THROUGH PLAYER ROLLS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 410)

When a PC rolls a 1, handle the GM intrusion the same way that you'd handle an intrusion you initiated. The intrusion could mean the PC fumbles or botches whatever they were trying to do, but it could mean something else. Consider these alternatives:

- In combat, the PC's foe is not as hurt as they thought. Give the foe 5 extra points of health.
- In combat, the PC drops their guard, and the foe gets a free attack.
- In combat, reinforcements for the PC's foes show up.
- In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally decides to flee.
- In combat (or any stressful situation), an ally doesn't like the PCs as much as they thought. The ally steals from them or betrays them.
- Out of combat, the PC's pack falls open, or the sole of their shoe tears open.
- Out of combat, it begins to rain heavily.
- Out of combat, a surprise foe appears, and the scene turns into a combat.
- In an interaction, the GM introduces a surprising motive for the NPC. For example, the PCs are trying to bribe an official for information, and the official reveals that what they really want isn't money but for someone to rescue their kidnapped son.

This might not be true of your players, but many players rarely, if ever, spend XP to refuse an intrusion from the GM, though they regularly use XP to avoid an intrusion that comes from a bad roll. And there's nothing wrong with that. Some GMs might want to forbid using an XP to reroll a 1, but there's really no point—if you've got an idea for a good intrusion, you don't need to wait until a player rolls a 1 to use it.

**Editor's Notes —** Optional rules like Horror Mode and other special effects can increase the "GM intrusion range" or "GM intrusion rate", making intrusions through player rolls more likely. For example, if an effect increases the GM intrusion rate by two points, the effected PC triggers a GM intrusion on a roll of 1–3.

#### EXTERNALIZING GM INTRUSION THROUGH PLAYER ROLLS

_This section has been added by the editor._

---

One of the keys to understanding GM intrusions is right there in the name—_intrusion_—even in response to a player rolling a 1. As noted in many of the example GM intrusions below, these moments don't have to be rooted in a PC failure, but instead can be something unexpected, undiscovered, and entirely external to the PC—something rooted in the world, situation, or opposition they are facing. It is an unfortunate fact that many players have had experience with games and GMs who respond to rolling a 1 by humiliating the PC, or preventing them from taking an action, but usually all this manages to do is bring the game to a halt. In the Cypher System, a good GM intrusion is revelatory: it reveals something about the world and invites further action in response. For example:

- If a PC is attempting to ask a prospective NPC romance out on a date and rolls a 1, you could have them make a fool out of themself—spilling their drink on the person, and completely ruining any chance to pursue that romance in the future. That's certainly an option, but it might not be the best one. Instead, you could reveal that the object of their affection already has a significant other—a jealous one, or perhaps an overprotective parent or sibling.
    
- If a PC is picking a lock in a dungeon, you could just have the PC fumble and break their lockpick, leaving the door shut forever. Or instead, the door could be yanked open—destroying the lockpick, and revealing a gaggle of angry orcs on the other side.
    

Whether they are triggered by a player rolling 1 or not, GM intrusions are there to help you be flexible: they can create corrective measures for the game pacing's or direction, make an important statement, or reveal a complication rooted in something the players overlooked, or bring something from the background of the story toward the center of it. In the end, the best GM intrusions don't delay the action, but help move the story forward.

### GM INTRUSION THAT AFFECTS THE GROUP

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 410)

The core of the idea behind GM intrusion is that the player being adversely affected gains an experience point. But what if the intrusion affects the whole group equally? What if the GM uses it to have an unstable device overload and explode, harming all the characters? In this case, if no PC is involved more than the others (for example, no single PC was frantically attempting to repair the device), you should give 1 XP to each character but not give any of them an extra XP to hand out to someone else.

However, this kind of group intrusion should be an exception, not the rule. GM intrusions are much more effective if they are more personal.

### EXAMPLE GM INTRUSIONS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

It's not a good idea to use the same events as GM intrusions over and over ("Dolmar dropped his sword again?"). Below are a number of different intrusions you can use.

**Editor's Notes —** GM intrusions are an integral part of Cypher System design. Most creatures and traps include at least one GM intrusion. GM intrusions are a crucial source of Experience Points (XP)—so make them a part of your session preparation!

#### BAD LUCK

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

Through no fault of the characters, something happens that is bad or at least complicating. For example:

- The floorboard beneath the PC gives way.
- The boat lists to starboard at just the wrong moment.
- A gust of wind blows the papers out of the character's hand.
- The buckle of the PC's pack snaps at an inopportune time.
- The NPC that the characters need to speak with is home sick today.
- A device (cypher or artifact) malfunctions or gives the user a jolt.

#### AN UNKNOWN COMPLICATION EMERGES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

The situation was more complex (and therefore more interesting) than the PCs knew—perhaps even more than the GM knew, at least at the start. For example:

- A poisonous snake darts out from the tall grass and attacks.
- The box that holds the plans is trapped with a poison needle.
- The NPC that the PCs need to befriend doesn't speak their language.
- The NPC that the PCs try to bribe is allergic to the bottle of alcohol they offer.
- The PCs find the book they need, but the pages are so brittle that if they open it, it might crumble.

#### AN IMPENDING COMPLICATION EMERGES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

GMs can use this type of intrusion as a resolution mechanic to determine NPC success or failure. Rather than rolling dice to see how long it takes an NPC to rewire a damaged force field generator, it happens at a time of the GM's choosing—ideally when it would be most interesting. For example:

- The goblin reinforcements finally get through the locked door.
- The ropes of the old rope bridge finally snap.
- The city guards show up.
- The unstable ceiling collapses.
- The NPC who holds a dagger to a character's throat and says "Don't move" cuts the PC when they do, in fact, move, putting them immediately at debilitated on the damage track.

#### OPPONENT LUCK OR SKILL

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

The PCs aren't the only ones with surprising tricks up their sleeves. For example:

- The PC's opponent uses a lightning-fast maneuver to dodge all attacks.
- The PC's opponent sees an opening and makes an additional, immediate attack.
- The NPC commander rallies their troops, who all deal 2 additional points of damage for one round.
- The PC's opponent uses a cypher or similar device that produces just the right effect for the situation.
- A bit of the wall collapses in the middle of the fight, preventing the characters from chasing the fleeing NPC.

#### FUMBLES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

Although you might not want every player roll of 1 to be a fumble, sometimes it could be just that. Alternatively, the GM could simply declare that a fumble has occurred. In either case, consider the following examples:

- In combat, the PC drops their weapon.
- In combat, the PC misses and strikes the wall, breaking or damaging their weapon.
- In combat, the NPC hits the PC harder than usual, inflicting 2 additional points of damage.
- In combat, the PC hits an ally by accident and inflicts regular damage.
- Out of combat, the PC drops or mishandles an important object or piece of equipment.
- In an interaction, the PC inadvertently or unknowingly says something offensive.

#### PARTIAL SUCCESS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 411)

GM intrusion doesn't have to mean that a PC has failed. For example:

- The PC disables the explosive device before it goes off, but if someone doesn't remain and hold the detonator, it will still explode.
- The PC creates the antidote, but it will turn the imbiber's flesh blue for the next few weeks.
- The PC jumps across the pit but accidentally knocks loose some stones from the edge, making the jump harder for their friend right behind them.

### PLAYER INTRUSIONS

### QUICK REFERENCE: PLAYER INTRUSIONS

- Warrior
- Adept
- Explorer
- Speaker
- Gaining a Subtle Cypher
- Gaining Insight
- Fairy Tale

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 412)

Player intrusions give the players a small bit of narrative control over the world. However, the world still remains in the GM's purview. You can always overrule a player intrusion, or suggest a way to massage it so that it fits better into the setting. Still, because it is indeed narrative control, a player intrusion should always involve a small aspect of the world beyond the character. "I punch my foe really hard" is an expression of Effort or perhaps character ability. "My foe slips and falls backward off the ledge" is a player intrusion.

Player intrusions should never be as big as GM intrusions. They should not end an encounter, only (perhaps) provide the PC with the means to more easily end an encounter. They should not have a wide-reaching or even necessarily a long-term effect on the setting. A way to consider this might be that player intrusions can affect a single object (a floorboard snaps), feature (there's a hidden shallow spot in the stream to ford), or NPC (the vendor is an old friend). But not more than that. A player intrusion can't affect a whole village or even a whole tavern in that village. A rock can come loose, but a player intrusion can't create a landslide.

**Editor's Notes —** In Chapter 5: : Type it is recommended that player intrusions be limited to no more than one per player per session.

## CYPHERS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 420)

You should think of cyphers as character abilities, whether they're subtle cyphers or manifest cyphers. This means that it is incumbent upon you to make sure that players always have plenty of cyphers to use. In the course of their travels, the PCs should find that cyphers are extremely common. And since the PCs are limited in the number of cyphers they can carry, they will use them liberally.

Manifest cyphers can be found by scavenging through old ruins. They can be found in the corpses of magical or technological foes. They can be found among the possessions of intelligent fallen opponents or the lairs of unintelligent creatures, either amid the bones of former meals or as shiny decorations in a nest. They can be found in villages, in the back of a merchant's cart that sells and scavenged parts. They are offered as rewards by people who are grateful for the PCs' help.

Some adventures will offer more cyphers than others. Still, as a rule of thumb, in any given adventure, a character should use at least as many cyphers as they can carry. This means they should find that number of cyphers in that same amount of time (give or take). Thus, you can simply add up the number of cyphers the PCs can carry, and on average, they should find at least that many cyphers in a given adventure.

If your players are typical, they will use combat-related cyphers liberally but hold onto their utility cyphers. A ray emitter or defensive shield will be used, but a suspensor belt or phasing module will linger longer on their character sheets.

As with everything else in the game, it's intentionally very easy for the GM to create new cyphers. Just think of the effect and how to express it as a game advantage. Two kinds of cyphers exist when it comes to effect: those that allow the user to do something better, and those that allow the user to do something they couldn't do otherwise.

The first group includes everything that reduces the difficulty of a task (including defense tasks). The second group includes things that grant new abilities, such as flight, a new means of attack, the ability to see into the past, or any number of other powers.

A few more important notes about devising new cyphers:

- Cyphers should be single-use items. The PCs use them up and find new ones.
- Cyphers should be potent. A minor ability isn't worth the trouble. If an attack cypher isn't as good as a regular weapon, why bother with it?
- Cyphers shouldn't have drawbacks.
- Cyphers should be temporary. Typically, a power is used once. Abilities or advantages that have a duration last from ten minutes to twenty-four hours (at most).
- Manifest cyphers can take any form. Just make them appropriate to the genre.

Cyphers teach GMs to design different kinds of scenarios—ones in which the whole adventure isn't wrecked if a player has something that can solve a single problem (defeat a foe, read a mind, bypass a barrier, or whatever). There should always be more to the adventure than one linchpin encounter, obstacle, foe, or secret.

It's all right if players think of cyphers (especially manifest cyphers) as equipment or treasure. You should choose points in the course of the story that are appropriate for awarding subtle cyphers, especially if the PCs aren't at their full capacity.

Finding a way to distribute cyphers quickly and efficiently can be a challenge. Old Gus' Cypher Decks (OG-CD) is a PDF that includes roll tables, card-sized handouts for each cypher, reference cards for the rules of cypher use, and templates for you to create your own cyphers ahead of—or during—the game.

#### ADDITIONAL CYPHERS

If you can't get enough cyphers, consider purchasing one the products in the What in the Book? section, or reading through Old Gus' Daft Drafts, Chapter 9: : Cyphers. These cyphers are also included in the OG-CD.

## ARTIFACTS

### QUICK REFERENCE: ARTIFACTS

- Fairy Tale (WAAMH, 91)
- Fantasy (GF, 145)
- Historical (309)
- Horror (282)(SA, 128)
- Pre-Apocalyptic (RR, 138)
- Post-Apocalyptic (300)(RR, 139)
- Science Fiction (275)(SF, 89)
- Science Fiction Vehicles (SF, 113)
- Superhero (294)

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 421)

In terms of the narrative, artifacts are a lot like cyphers, except that most are not one-use items. Mechanically, they serve a very different purpose. It's assumed that characters are exploring with some cyphers at their disposal. Artifacts, however, are added abilities that make characters broader, deeper, and often more powerful. They aren't assumed—they're extra.

The powers granted by artifacts are more like the abilities gained from a character's type or focus in that they change the way the PC is played overall. The difference between an artifact and a type or focus ability is that almost all artifacts are temporary. They last longer than cyphers do, but because they have a depletion roll, any use could be their last.

Like cyphers, then, artifacts are a way for the GM to play a role in the development of the characters. Although armor, weapons, and the like are fine, special capabilities—such as long-range communication or travel—can really change the way the PCs interact with the world and how they deal with challenges. Some of these abilities enable the actions you want the PCs to take. For example, if you want them to have an underwater adventure, provide them with artifacts (or cyphers) that allow them to breathe underwater.

Also like cyphers, artifacts are simple for the GM to create. The only difference with artifacts is that you give them a depletion roll, using any numbers on 1d6, 1d10, 1d20, or 1d100. If you want the artifact to be used only a few times, give it a depletion roll of 1 in 1d6, 1 or 2 in 1d10, or even 1 or 2 in 1d6. If you want the PCs to use it over and over, a depletion roll of 1 in 1d100 more or less means that they can use it freely without worrying too much.

You may wish to forbid the use of XP to reroll artifact depletion rolls. That's pretty reasonable.

**Editor's Notes —** For more on artifacts, see Artifacts in Chapter 10: : Equipment.

## SKILLS AND OTHER ABILITIES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 421)

Sometimes, the rules speak directly to character creativity. For example, players can make up their own skills. It's possible to have a skill called "tightrope walking" that grants a character a better chance to walk across a tightrope, and another skill called "balance" that gives a character a better chance to walk across a tightrope and perform other balance actions as well. This might seem unequal at first, but the point is to let players create precisely the characters they want. Should you let a character create a skill called "doing things" that makes them better at everything? Of course not. The GM is the final arbiter not only of logic but also of the spirit of the rules, and having one or two single skills that cover every contingency is clearly not in the spirit.

It's important that players play the character they want. This concept is supported not only with the open-ended skill system but also with the ability to get an experience point advance to tailor a character further. Likewise, the GM should be open to allowing a player to make small modifications to refine their character. In many cases, particularly ones that don't involve stat Pools, Armor, damage inflicted, or the costs of Effort or special abilities, the answer from the GM should probably be "Sure, why not?" If a PC ends up being really good at a particular skill—better than they "should" be—what's the harm? If Dave can swim incredibly well, how does that hurt the game in terms of the play experience or the story that develops? It doesn't. If Helen can pick practically any mundane lock she finds, why is that a bad thing? In fact, it's probably good for the game—there's likely something interesting on the other sides of those doors.

In a way, this is no different than adjudicating a not-so-straightforward solution to a challenge. Sometimes you have to say "No, that's not possible." But sometimes, if it makes sense, open yourself up to the possibility.

### SKILL CATEGORIES

_This section is based on [The (Unwritten) Rules on Skills in Numenera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEVmVDW-gjU) by the Infinite Construct, paraphrased by the editor._

---

Here is a framework for thinking about skills and character progression: Because skills are one way of modifying the difficulty of a task, it can be helpful to think of a skill as falling into one the following three categories:

- **Broad Skills** are applicable to large number of possible tasks. For example, "positive social interaction" is a broad skill that can apply to a variety of tasks that involve social pleasantry: etiquette, flattery, persuasion, negotiation, seduction, and even deception. Likewise, a crafting skill like "metalworking" might be considered a broad skill that allows a PC represents some training in metallurgy, working a forge, and creating different types of finishes for several kinds of well-known metals on a completed object.
    
- **Narrow Skills** are less frequent in their application, and they frequently build upon a broad skill. For example, "negotiation" might be a specialization within a broad "positive social interaction" skill. Likewise, "weaponsmithing", "bronze casting", "hull welding", and "jewelrymaking" might be specific skills that fall under a broad "metalworking" skill. The GM should consider what each of these specializations says about the PC. Are they a warrior? An artist? A craftsperson?
    
    A GM might decide that some skills are so broad that it is impossible to become specialized in them, and a player must instead choose a narrow skill under the broad skill. For example, if the GM considers "stealth" as applicable to too many different types of tasks, they might require the character specialize in picking pockets, sleight of hand, sneaking, or hiding instead.
    
- **Specialized Knowledge** skills might be uniquely important to the game world or campaign, with only a certain few that possess them. The Cypher System assumes PCs are broadly competent: the default state of any given skill is Practiced. However, the GM might decide that when it comes to a few select skills, PCs are assumed to have an inability with those skills unless they begin the game trained in them.
    
    For example, in a science fiction setting, being able to decipher the language of a long-dead ancient species might be specialized knowledge, and the GM might allow characters to rid themselves of the inability as part of choosing a skill as part of character advancement.
    
    Specialized knowledge is also useful when thinking about crafting. In a fantasy setting, "elven weaponsmithing" might be a specialized knowledge skill within the broad "metalworking" skill. if a PC is already trained in metalworking and completes a Master a Skill character arc, they might be able to specialize in "elven weaponsmithing", which would then enable them begin to use the rules for crafting magic items. In a superhero setting where magic is rare, a PC without an ability like Magic Training might be assumed to have an inability on tasks related to understanding magic, with no established way of gaining any magical talent.

## NPCS AND DEATH

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 424)

As explained in Chapter 11: : Rules of the Game, NPCs have a health score rather than three stat Pools. When an NPC reaches 0 health, they are down. Whether that means dead, unconscious, or incapacitated depends on the circumstances as dictated by you and the players. Much of this can be based on logic. If the NPC is cut in half with a giant axe, they're probably dead. If they're mentally assaulted with a telepathic attack, they might be insane instead. If they're hit over the head with a club, well, that's your call.

It depends on the intentions of those who are fighting the NPC, too. PCs who want to knock out a foe rather than kill them can simply state that as their intention and describe their actions differently—using the flat of the blade, so to speak.

---

## CREATURES

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 425)

Whenever possible, creatures should be handled like other NPCs. They don't follow the same rules as the player characters. If anything, they should have greater latitude in doing things that don't fit the normal mold. A many-armed beast should be able to attack multiple foes. A charging rhino-like animal ought to be able to move a considerable distance and attack as part of a single action.

Consider creature size very carefully. For those that are quick and hard to hit, hinder attacks against them. Large, strong creatures should be easier to hit, so ease attacks against them. However, you should freely give the stagger ability to anything twice as large as a human. This means that if the creature strikes a foe, the target must make an immediate Might defense roll or lose its next turn.

A creature's level is a general indicator of its toughness, combining aspects of power, defense, intelligence, speed, and more into one rating. In theory, a small creature with amazing powers or extremely deadly venom could be high level, and a huge beast that isn't very bright and isn't much of a fighter could be low level. But these examples go against type. Generally, smaller creatures have less health and are less terrifying in combat than larger ones.

The Cypher System has no system for building creatures. There is no rule that says a creature with a certain ability should be a given level, and there is no rule dictating how many abilities a creature of a given level should have. But keep the spirit of the system in mind. Lower-level creatures are less dangerous. A level 1 creature could be poisonous, but its venom should inflict a few points of damage at most. The venom of a level 6 creature, however, might knock a PC down a step on the damage track or put them into a coma if they fail a Might defense roll. A low-level creature might be able to fly, phase through objects, or teleport because these abilities make it more interesting but not necessarily more dangerous. The value of such abilities depends on the creature that uses them. In other words, a phasing rodent is not overly dangerous, but a phasing battle juggernaut is terrifying. Basic elements such as health, damage, and offensive or defensive powers (such as poison, paralysis, disintegration, immunity to attacks, and so on) need to be tied directly to level—higher-level creatures get better abilities and more of them.

#### BEEFED UP

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 435)

Apply the following stat adjustments to a beefed up creature.

- +1 level
- +10 health
- +1 Armor
- +3 damage inflicted

**Multiple Boosts:** If you need a really beefed up foe, you can boost a creature more than once.

**Editor's Notes —** This example template is based on Challenging Characters (435) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), and provides a basic "boost package"—for example, turning a goblin into a more powerful "hobgoblin" variant. It also gives you an idea on how to start creating your own templates.

#### BIGGER AND TOUGHER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 97)

If you need a larger or tougher version of a creature, such as a dire wolf or a giant crocodile, you can just increase the creature's level (and all of its modifications) by 1 or 2. If the creature has a damage or health stat that isn't the default for its level, take that into account at the modified creature's new level.

A simple rule of thumb is to double a creature's size (length, width, and height) for every level it increases.

- **Stagger:** If the creature strikes a foe, the target must make an immediate Might defense roll or lose their next turn.
    

**Editor's Notes —** The difficulty to avoid a stagger is the level of the creature (unless any modifications change that). Repeatedly losing a turn will probably not be much fun for most players, so consider "dazing" the PCs, hindering their actions instead.

#### BLIGHTED

(RUST AND REDEMPTION, PAGE 94)

A blighted creature or NPC is touched by a mutation and/or a contagion that makes them more dangerous than standard creatures of their type. It is scarred and twisted in some way, and possibly slightly bigger—or at least wirier—than average, which explains why it's survived so long, even blighted. A blighted creature shows signs of degradation—such as a bacterial, viral, or even mycological infection-tracing disturbing sores, scars, or encrustations across its skin or hide. The specifics are up to you. Many blighted creatures and people are hungry and hurt, acting rabidly. But an NPC could just as easily retain human sentiment despite their deteriorated condition.

Apply the following stat adjustments to a blighted creature.

- Increase the creature's level by 1 and increase all its related stats by the appropriate amount (1 more point of average damage, 3 more points of health, and so on).
- The creature's perception tasks are hindered by two steps; whatever blights the creature is slowly blinding it.
- In bright light, the creature's tasks are hindered. (A blighted human could wear shades to nullify this hindrance; other creatures might come up with similar tactics or stay in shadows when possible.)
- The creature's scratches, bites, spittle, or similar attacks contain a contagion known as "the blight."

**The Blight:** The creature is a contagion vector for the same agent that blights it, whether that's radiation, bacteria, a virus, mycological spores, or something stranger. Treat the contagion as a disease with a level equal to the blighted creature's level. The affected creature's tasks are hindered by one additional step each day a Might defense roll is failed. For each two steps a target is hindered, it also moves one step down the damage track. When a target moves down the third step, either it dies (20% chance) or it survives but gains the Blighted template (80% chance). A blighted creature loses the hindrance described in this paragraph.

**Editor's Notes —** The blighted template is perfect for a post-apocalyptic setting, but works just as well in a fantasy setting.

## CREATING CREATURES AND NPCS

_This section is based on NPC Game Stats (422) and [Make a Cypher System Creature in Ten Minutes or Less](https://www.montecookgames.com/make-a-creature-in-10-minutes-or-less-2/) by Charles Ryan, paraphrased by the editor._

---

It doesn't take a lot of preparation to create a memorable creature or NPC. You don't have to follow all of the following steps, but if you find yourself more time and energy, take the next step on the checklist:

- **Level, Motive, and Combat:** Decide on the level, motive, and general tactics and key behaviors of the NPC.
    
- **Movement, Modifications and Interaction:** Decide what is most important about the NPC for your purposes. This might be defining its movement, tasks it is particularly skilled with, or weaknesses it might have with certain tasks. Refer back to the creature's motive and refine how thinks and behaves—especially if the PCs might try to interact with it, and if it requires any signature combat tactics or special abilities. Describing for players what the creature does is important—describing _how the NPC does it_ is equally important. If it's supposed to be creepy, detail that creepiness.
    
- **GM Intrusion:** Consider what might happens if a player triggers a GM intrusion, or create a twist you'd like to be able to propose in an encounter.
    
- **Health:** A creature's health dictates how long it will survive in combat. A party of four tier 1–2 characters typically inflict 10 points of damage each round. Tier 3–4 characters typically inflict 16 points of damage, and tier 5–6 characters typically inflict 22 points per round.
    
- **Armor:** Armor reduces how quickly an NPC's health is depleted. One point of Armor is typically equivalent to adding 6–7 points of health.
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** You can increase damage inflicted if necessary. Even low-level creatures inflict at least 2–3 points of damage. During combat, creatures typically damage the PCs twice.
    
- **Special Damage:** Decide if the creature can inflict any kind of special damage—venom, entanglement, stun, mental control, temporary reductions to Pools, even moving characters down the damage track without depleting their Pools. If employing such effects, decide on what conditions that alleviate them, for example, a successful Might defense roll made each hour, a successful healing task against the level of a poison, or completing a ten-hour recovery roll. These effects can certainly make an NPC more interesting, but don't overuse them.
    
- **Use and Loot:** Describe at least one way the party might be likely to discover or encounter the creature. If the creature is likely to have any useful loot, such as a cypher, equipment, or part of its body, note that, too.

## BALANCING ENCOUNTERS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 434)

In the Cypher System, there is no concept of a "balanced encounter." There is no system for matching creatures of a particular level or tasks of a particular difficulty to characters of a particular tier. To some people, that might seem like a bad thing. But matching character builds to exacting challenges is not part of this game. It's about story. So whatever you want to happen next in the story is a fine encounter as long as it's fun. You're not denying the characters XP if you make things too easy or too difficult, because that's not how XP are earned. If things are too difficult for the PCs, they'll have to flee, come up with a new strategy, or try something else entirely. The only thing you have to do to maintain "balance" is set difficulty within that encounter accurately and consistently.

In a game like the Cypher System, if everyone's having fun, the game is balanced. Two things will unbalance the game in this context.

- One or more PCs are far more interesting than the others. Note that it says "more interesting," not "more powerful." If my character can do all kinds of cool things but can't destroy robots as efficiently as yours does, I still might have a whole lot of fun.
    
- The challenges the PCs face are routinely too easy or too difficult.
    

The first issue should be handled by the character creation rules. If there's a problem, it might be that poor choices were made or a player isn't taking full advantage of their options. If someone really doesn't enjoy playing their character, allow them to alter the PC or—perhaps better—create a new one.

The second issue is trickier. As previously stated, there is no formula that states that N number of level X NPCs are a good match for tier Y characters. However, when the game has four or five beginning characters, the following guidelines are generally true.

- Level 1 opponents will be nothing but a nuisance, even in sizable numbers (twelve to sixteen).
- Level 2 opponents will not be a challenge unless in numbers of twelve or more.
- Level 3 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of four to eight.
- Level 4 opponents will be an interesting challenge in numbers of two or three.
- A single level 5 opponent might be an interesting challenge.
- A single level 6 opponent will be a serious challenge.
- A single level 7 or 8 opponent will likely win in a fight.
- A single level 9 or 10 opponent will win in a fight without breaking a sweat.

But it depends on the situation at hand. If the PCs are already worn down from prior encounters, or if they have the right cyphers, any of the expectations listed above can change. That's why there is no system for balancing encounters. Just keep in mind that beginning characters are pretty hardy and probably have some interesting resources, so you aren't likely to wipe out the group by accident. Character death is unlikely unless the PCs have already been through a number of other encounters and are worn down.

### CREATING CHALLENGING ENCOUNTERS

_This section is based on Challenging Characters (435) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

If you find your PCs are breezing through encounters, try some of the following ideas:

- **Templates:** Modify creatures to create new and more challenging variants of creatures or NPCs.
    
- **Damage Track:** An attack or effect immediately moves a PC one step down the damage track.
    
- **Ongoing Damage:** An attack or effect inflicts additional damage each round until PCs find a way to counteract it.
    
- **Lasting Damage:** A PC gains an injury, which reduces the maximum number of points in one or more of their Pools. The PC can regain 1 point to their maximum each day they spend resting, or 1 point every three days of regular activity. Until their Pool point maximum is fully restored, any tasks appropriate to the injury are hindered by one or more steps (determined by the GM). Conditions in Old Gus' Daft Drafts contains a number of potential injury frameworks.
    
- **Permanent Damage:** Permanent injuries should be used sparingly, but can be interesting. Even a permanent damage might one day be counteracted by appropriate technology, magic, or completion of a character arc like Recover From a Wound (or Trauma).
    
- **Damaging Abilities or Equipment:** An attack temporarily hinders the use of, nullifies—or in rare instances, completely destroys—a PC's special ability, cypher, or artifact.
    
- **Enemies Working in Concert:** If four creatures work together, add +1 to the highest level creature, and +2 additional points of damage. A level 4 mafia cap with three level 3 triggermen could team up and attack as a level 5 NPC, dealing 6 damage instead of 4. This is a useful way of pooling enemies who normally can't overcome a PC's Armor.
    
- **Dangerous Environs:** Unstable terrain, hazards, or extreme weather can all be realized through the Horror Mode rule, causing more frequent GM intrusions triggered in response to player rolls.

### HOUSE RULE: EFFORT FOR NPCS

_This section based [Optional Rule: Effort for NPCs](https://www.montecookgames.com/optional-rule-effort-for-npcs) by Monte Cooke, paraphrased by the editor._

---

In addition to GM intrusion, this rule provides the GM with a way to allow NPCs, creatures, or followers to use Effort just like PCs. An NPC using Effort on an action temporarily increases their effective level. In situations that don't involve PCs, Effort allows an NPC to rise to the occasion in a daring combat between NPCs, or to succeed at a particularly daunting task. However, because the player always rolls, NPCs using Effort can affect the difficulty of the PC's roll:

- If an NPC uses a level of Effort to defend themselves, the PC's attack is hindered.
- If an NPC uses a level of Effort ease an attack or special ability, the PC's defense roll against it is hindered.
- If an NPC uses a level of Effort to increase damage and the PC fails their defense roll, the amount of damage inflicted is increased by 3—or by 2, if it was an area attack.

#### ASSIGNING EFFORT TO NPCS

In addition to health and other modifications, assigning how much Effort an NPC can use and how they use it is a great way to create dynamic individualized NPCs. The GM might assign a different types and levels of Effort for different NPCs. When assigning Effort to an NPC, the GM should consider the following options:

- **Effort from Health:** Some NPCs can spend 1 health point to use one level of Effort. This is a major expense to a level 2 NPC, but a not a big deal to a level 6 NPC. This option is easy to account for, since health is already defined in the creature's listing.
    
- **Effort from Level:** Some NPCs can use one level Effort a number of times equal to their level. This is a little trickier, requiring the GM to keep track of the NPC's available Effort. However, it might be a better method for followers the PC accounts for.
    
- **Multiple Levels of Effort:** A few NPCs might be able to use multiple levels Effort. An NPC can't use a number of levels of Effort that exceeds their level, nor can they exceed the six-step limit for easing a task.
    
- **Recovering Effort:** Persistent NPCs and followers should regain their ability to use of Effort, after a length of time determined by the GM.
    

#### EXAMPLE NPCS WITH EFFORT

- **Berserker Clan:** The GM creates a tribe of raging level 3 berserkers with **Effort from Health**. Most of the berserkers can only spend one level of Effort at a time, but the GM allows the chieftain to spend up to three levels of Effort, spending 1 health point for each level of Effort she uses. This allows the chieftain to threaten the party's heavily armored warrior with deadly accuracy and damage. The GM also assigns the chieftain additional health for her spend her Effort from.
    
- **Werewolf Pack:** The GM creates a pack of level 4 werewolves with **Effort from Level** and **Multiple Levels of Effort**. Each werewolf might use their four levels of Effort differently: one level of Effort four times, two levels of Effort twice, or four levels of Effort just once (or some other combination). The point is that where, when, and how each werewolf uses their Effort becomes a source of drama within the story.

## CAMPAIGN DESIGN CHECKLIST

_This section has been added by the editor._

---

This campaign design checklist guides you—the GM—in establishing the game setting, preparing players to create PCs ahead of the first session. You don't have to perform every step on the list, and you don't have all the answers right now. Oftentimes, discussing things with players will help you with answers you don't have, and in a longer campaign, you will almost certainly revise your answers as time goes on. You can use this process to fill out the official Campaign Design Worksheet included in Monte Cook Games' [Cypher System Character Portfolios and Character Sheets](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-character-and-campaign-sheets/).

### ESTABLISHING CAMPAIGN BASICS

- **Name of the Game:** Name your campaign something evocative and exciting. You might already be hinting at the kinds of adventures, mysteries, genres, locations or other important aspects of setting—including the kinds of characters PCs should expect to create.
    
- **GM Contact:** Make sure your players know how to get in touch with you to talk about the game.
    
- **Select Genre(s):** Make note of the informing genres the game will operate in.
    

### DEFINING THE GENRE FOR PLAYERS

- **Define Skills:** Make a list of useful skills for the setting and genre. Add any new skills that are needed, including languages. If the setting includes magic or involves exploring great unknowns, it might also be a good time to consider defining any skill categories and expected inabilities most PCs will share.
    
- **Define Types:** Establish the types PCs can play. You might also want to define a new type with a flavor, including any further customization you make.
    
- **Suggest Descriptors:** Create a list of suggested descriptors. With so many descriptors available, limiting the number of choices is not necessarily a bad thing: the goal is to spotlight the descriptors that will be most meaningful to the kinds of stories the genre or setting will make most rewarding to play. Now is also a good time to think about if and how the game will use species as descriptor, or if you want to customize descriptors.
    
- **Suggest Foci:** Provide a list of suggested foci, just as you did for the descriptors. Each genre contains a list of suggested foci to help you with this step. You can also customize a focus or create a new focus at this time.
    
- **Choose Cyphers:** Create a list of appropriate cyphers to provide to the players. Think about where, when, and how players will gain cyphers—this might look different depending on if you are using primarily subtle cyphers or manifest cyphers. Using a cypher deck can also facilitate handing out cyphers, using them, and resolving what they do.
    
- **Select Optional Rules:** Create a list of optional rules you want players to know about, and where to find them. If players need to read the rules or character options, consider recommending Old Gus' Unofficial Cypher System Player's Guide.
    
- **Something's Still Missing!:** If you're adapting a setting to the Cypher System, there are often game mechanics that don't seem like they quite fit in. Some things might be best harnessed as a Use for XP—including new character advancement options, or player intrusions that provide a vocabulary for the kinds of cool "moves" a player can make on a limited basis that aren't addressed by character creation. Don't worry if you don't know how to do it all right now: if there are mechanics you aren't sure about, implement them as cyphers at first—this is a good test bed because cyphers can only be used once. Don't worry too much about game mechanics when writing these, just use own plain language. After the cypher is used, if it's something you'd like to see more of, you can reintroduce the cypher, or refine it into an artifact (which deplete randomly). When the artifact depletes, you can always provide the PCs with a way (for example, spending 3 XP) to recharge the artifact, or allow them to gain its effects permanently as a special ability with an appropriate initial cost for its effects.
    

### WRAPPING UP

- **Write the Pitch:** There's no wrong way to write a campaign pitch. You might write out your idea for the game in the style of a movie trailer, provide reference a list of influential media, or write a few paragraphs of relevant world history. Whatever you decide, be sure your pitch communicates any expectations you have for the kinds of people the PCs will portray, and what kinds of activities they game will center upon. Leave some room in the idea so that players can bring their own ideas to the table.
    
- **Set Boundaries:** Work through the [Consent in Gaming](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/consent-in-gaming/) tool from Monte Cook Games, or other campaign safety tool of your choice with the players.
    
- **Take Notes:** Throughout this process, make note of questions to be answered later, and things you'd like to discuss with players, or anything else that excites you about the PCs the players create.

## SESSION PREPARATION

_This section is based on Preparing for the Game Session (431) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

In the Cypher System, there aren't too many rules you have to memorize to run the game. Instead, the Cypher System is designed to allow the GM and players to allow the game to proceed without the need for a lot pre-planned content. Allowing the game to unfold on its own means anything the GM plans might not get used, or might get used differently than planned for. The GM should leave themself some room to be flexible, filling in blanks and details as the game proceeds. Remember that since the player always rolls, use your time and brainpower to examine the players actions and moods, the unfolding story, and keep track where the trajectory of the game is headed.

The campaign design checklist can help you define certain things about the setting, but all you really need to be prepared are a list of names, a scenario summary, and a list of ideas.

### A LIST OF NAMES

A list of names appropriate to the game's setting is useful for creating NPCs in the moment. Having a little extra room on the list to add a level, a modification, and a quick note next to a name is a good way of recording which names have become NPCs, and who they are. A useful set of notes for an NPC might include their level, important modifications, their motive (what they want), and means (how they intend to get it), or anything else that will help you remember them later.

Example Fairy Tale NPC Names and Notes

|Name|Details|
|---|---|
|Ourmand Armstay|—|
|Gwendolyn Goodnoodle|—|
|Sandy Sugarbottom|—|
|Brampton Underrug|_Halfling; nervous disposition; general goods merchant; level 2, haggles as level 5_|
|Sigourney Otherbeef|—|

If a powerful creature or NPC is central to the scenario, it can be wise to spend a few minutes to choose creatures and NPCs, and review their characteristics to determine if they need modification, or creating new creatures or NPCs.

### A SCENARIO SUMMARY

A scenario summary sets up the general situation the PCs will be involved in, but doesn't assume anything what the players will do about it—players will always do unexpected things.

Knowing just a little bit about how things are connected will allow the players to interact with the scenario organically (as opposed to in an order and manner of your design). You might want to refer back to that list of names and come up with something on the fly. The PCs might investigate the situation on their own, or decide that there are other things they'd rather be doing than looking for missing shoes or people.

#### EXAMPLE SCENARIO SUMMARY: A SKELETON STOLE MY SHOES!

In a fantasy world, the PCs are traveling through a forest of thick, tall, trees, and happen upon Bamwich—a cozy hamlet inhabited mostly by gentle moss dwarves. There is a chill in the air, but an inviting column of smoke rises from a nearby tavern with doors fit for a human.

- **Old Gus** _(the oldest dwarf in town; level 1; local history as level 4)_ loudly complains to anyone who will listen that a skeleton has stolen his favorite pair of shoes. Gus is eager to get the PCs to help him by retrieving them, and could be convinced to offer a reward for their safe return.
    
- **Lil' Mama and Large Marge** _(tavern proprietors; level 2)_ are hiding an infestation of rats—including two giant rats—in the tavern's underground larder.
    
- **Renengil** _(a skilled blacksmith; level 3)_ hasn't heard from her cousin Herferlun in a week. Herferlun is the foreman at an iron mine in the nearby woods. In addition to dwindling supplies, she is worried about her cousin. She would investigate the matter herself, but is busy with her work.
    
- **Hamish Wormworthy** _(an incompetent Necromancer; all tasks hindered)_ has sent forth his Skeleton minions to "collect the souls of the living", but his incompetence has them seeking out the _soles_ of the living instead—causing the skeletons to steal people's shoes instead of killing them. His cavernous lair is becoming increasing littered with footwear.
    
- **Dwarven miners** _(level 2)_ are captured by Hamish, and are being turned into skeletons by the necromancer. Renengil's cousin, Herferlun is among the survivors.
    

### A LIST OF IDEAS

A list of ideas provides you with a box of toys you can interject into the game. They might provide useful tonal clues, a striking sensory description, or possible clues or side plots. It can also be a good idea prepare a few GM intrusions for a session. Coming up with one GM intrusion each for important locations, creatures, NPCs, situations, or the PCs' character arcs can provide you with the vocabulary you need to be ready when a PC rolls a 1, or to have something ready to propose that would be good for the story or game. Additionally, Monte Cook Games' [GM Intrusion Deck](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/gm-intrusion-deck/) that includes a wealth of possible GM intrusions.

For _A Skeleton Stole My Shoes!_, a list of ideas might include:

- Someone's food or drink in the tavern is served with a large, wiry hair in it.
- An animal caught in a hunter's trap is actually a fey being.
- A skeleton missing a skull stumbles through the woods.
- A ghostly green torchlight increases skeletons' level by 1.
- An artifact of great power is rumored to be held in an ancient shrine to a fallen hero somewhere deep in the woods.

Lastly, it can also be a good idea to choose a few cyphers appropriate to the setting. Come up with a way to provide that information to players, for example, a cypher deck. For _A Skeleton Took My Shoes_, potential cyphers might include:

- Anathema Siren (undead)
- Curative
- Friction Reducer
- Sleep Inducer
- Trick Embedder
- Undead Ward

## TEACHING THE RULES

_This section has been added by the editor based on Teaching The Rules (426) [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

This section explores some collected advice on streamlining the process of teaching new players. It's a generally a good idea to get players to read through Chapter 3: : How to Play the Cypher System, the [Cypher System Reference Rules Primer](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rules-primer/). You might also want to go over Monte Cook Games' [Consent in Gaming](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/consent-in-gaming/) checklist individually with each player.

Alternatively, Old Gus' Unofficial Cypher System Player's Guide (OG-CSPG) contains everything players need to know to play the game in a condensed format, including all character options presented in the CSRD. You can also download the OG-CSPG in PDF for printable character options. New players might also find Old Gus' Cypher System Quick-Reference provides basic rules and game vocabulary at-a-glance.

It's common for players to take a little while to learn the Cypher System's vocabulary for game mechanics, especially if they've already played other games that have a different vocabulary. When you mention a game mechanic like recovery rolls or the damage track, take a moment to define those terms, and point out where that information is located on the PC's character sheets.

It's also a good idea to let players know a little bit about what to expect about the game's genre and setting. The Campaign Design Checklist can help you organize your thoughts and communicate them to players. This helps players know who their PC is, and a little bit about what kinds of stories to expect.

### CALLING FOR ROLLS

When it comes to rolling the die, players will learn the game faster if the GM calls for rolls using a consistent approach. Remind players that any action PC's take is resolved the same way. Here are a few steps you can take to smooth out calling for rolls and resolving them with players:

- **Tie the Action to a Stat:** determine which stat is being tested: Might, Speed, or Intellect. If you're not sure which to use, ask the player _how_ their PC is doing what they are doing.
    
- **Set the Difficulty:** Select a task difficulty—usually between 0–10, and decide if any modifications are required—these might come from a creature's listed modifications, or external circumstances that might ease or hinder the task by one or more step (for example, a strong wind interfering with—or aiding—a PC's jump across a wide chasm).
    
- **Inform the Player:** Tell the player which stat the task will test, and the difficulty—but don't mention the target number yet. For clarity's sake, the less conversion between those two different number sets, the better. You can withhold or be vague about difficulty if you like, but new players tend to benefit from knowing the difficulty until they get the hang of things.
    
- **Modify the Difficulty:** Guide the player through modifying the difficulty using their skills, assets, and Effort. It good to set a few low difficulties players can modify all the way to 0, becoming a routine action, and succeed without a roll. If you are setting an impossible difficulty—7 or higher—inform the player that the task can't succeed unless they modify the difficulty in their favor. You might need to remind them about applicable skills, any assets they possess, and to use Effort at first. If another player wants to use their action to help, that's a good thing!
    
- **Announce the Target Number:** Multiply the final difficulty by 3, inform the player of the target number, and prompt them to roll the die.
    
- **Resolve the Action:** Narrate the results of the roll. If the PC used a special ability or Effort, total all Pool point costs, then subtract their Edge in the task stat from the total. Some players will use Effort on every roll at first. If players mention their Pool points are running low, remind them that their first recovery roll takes only one action to use.
    

### KEEPING TRACK OF NUMBERS

The GM might use tokens—for example, [XP Deck cards](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-xp-deck/) or colored poker chips—to represent Might, Speed, and Intellect Pools. This can make counting out points lost due to using special abilities and Effort, or damage easier for some players. Once a player counts out their total costs, remind them to refund points due to Edge or Armor.

### ENCOURAGING PLAYERS TO SPEND XP

It is a common struggle to get players to look past character advancement and start spending experience points for short-, medium- or long-term benefits and player intrusions. Here are a few ways a GM can use to encourage players to spend (and earn) more XP, which is intended to be given, received, and spent with some frequency. In fact, if the Cypher System has a heartbeat, this is it.

- **XP Cards or Tokens:** Using a physical object as an XP token—for example, coins, [XP Deck cards](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-xp-deck/), poker chips, or a carefully aligned d10—can be a good way to formalize the fundamentally transactional nature of XP. As a side benefit, accounting for XP this way also means less accounting by erasing and rewriting numbers on a paper character sheet.
    
- **GM Intrusions:** GM intrusions generate a lot XP, so if you are the GM, use them—and if you are a player, accept them! The GM might even consider granting XP even when a GM intrusion is the result of a player rolling a 1 on the die. GMs should aim to offer at least one GM intrusion to each player every session.
    
- **Player Intrusions:** Some players who aren't used to having more narrative control might be reluctant to propose a player intrusion. If no one is using player intrusions, try proposing a few you think they'd like, or using the Gaining Insight optional rule. Devise a few proposed player intrusions for each PC—you can make it something only they could—or would—think of. Once players see a few examples, they'll be more prepared to start proposing their own intrusions.
    
- **Attendance:** Offering 1–2 consistent XP at the start of the session just for showing up makes it easier to spend some.
    
- **Character Arcs:** Reserve some time at the end of each session to discuss the PC's character arcs, and assign a XP value for any steps completed.
    
- **Equal Advancement:** If using Equal Advancement, consider a house rule where any XP earned in the session must be spent in the same session—establish a limit on the amount of XP a PC can hoard, or deciding unspent XP expires at the start of the next session.
    

### ENCOURAGING PLAYERS TO USE CYPHERS

The cypher limit is a social contract between the GM and the players. The GM provides useful cyphers that allow PCs to perform amazing abilities, and the players agree to use them, then the GM provides new cyphers, and so on. Having a fresh set of cyphers to distribute and use keeps gameplay fresh and allows each character to engage each situation differently than the last. It can be wise to provide cyphers in caches of 1d6 cyphers at a time, and allow players to discard cyphers in their possession that do not seem immediately useful.

Another option is to ask the players to review their cyphers at the start of the session, and cause cyphers to "expire". This runs the risk of coming off as punitive, but it might also provide the motivation some players need to use their cyphers, search for new ones, or to use a player intrusion to request a subtle cypher, or to prevent a manifest cypher they'd been saving for a specific purpose from expiring.

Using a cypher deck can speed up the distribution and resolution of cyphers without the need to write lengthy effects onto a character sheet, and serve as a good physical reminder of something the player has that they can use to affect the situation. A physical object is also a good reminder to the players that they quite literally might "have a card to play".

## MAKING MEANING

_This section is based on The Rules Versus the Story (403), Consistency (405), Adjudicating (412), Logic (413), Dice Rolling (414), Dealing with Character Abilities (418), Encouraging Player Creativity (420), Character Arcs (421), Handling NPCs (422), Pacing (428), Description (430), and Handling the Players (433) in the [Cypher System Rulebook](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/cypher-system-rulebook-2/), paraphrased by the editor._

---

While the advice in this section will talk about some Cypher System specifics, the basic principles can be applied to playing what I call "the game"—regardless of the system or rules you use to play. "The game" in this case is called _Make-Believe_. That's important: you want to _make the players want to believe_ in the world and the setting, and they want to _make you want to believe_ in their PCs—even though we all know the story isn't real, the point is to make is as believable—and furthermore, as meaningful—as possible. When we succeed at _Make-Believe_, and everyone is having a good time, the game is being "won", to the extent that it ever can be.

The rules of any given game system are there to set up certain boundaries for our imagination. They determine what counts (in terms of maths), what is possible, and what is not—at least, at a baseline. In the Cypher System, there only a few important mechanics that can't be changed. PC stats, Pool, Effort, and XP are foundational to the Cypher System's mechanics, but you can change almost anything else—and maybe you should. Your choices will help you define the exact genre of the game—at least at first. They determine what defines "believable" within _Make-Believe_. For example, in a fantasy setting, magic is perfectly believable. In a post-apocalyptic setting caused by nuclear war, magic may not be very believable—but it could still be interesting. What's believable can also change dramatically over the course of a story—many great stories are based around the very idea of discovering new aspects of existence, and the Cypher System is—at its core—about discovery.

A key feature in the game of _Make-Believe_ is that everything in the story has some amount of "meaningfulness". Meaningfulness defines what matters in the story, and separates what is important from what is not. Without sufficient meaningfulness, a story is "just a bunch of stuff that happens". When something is meaningful in a story, it creates a kind of gravitational force that pulls other parts of the story toward itself—making a near pass of one another, entering a kind of orbital relationship, sharing it apart in a terrible gravitation tide, or causing an impact. Without this force, everything just kind floats around independently before scattering into oblivion. Building the right kind of good meaningful gravity in the game is essential. The rest of this section explores things you can do to build good meaningful gravity—enough to eventually slingshot your game on to new worlds.

### ENCOURAGING PLAY: UNCLENCH YOUR BUTT!

Once you know what is makes things believable within the setting, it's time to turn the players loose within it. PCs will already bring a good amount of their own meaningfulness to the game—they are the main characters, after all. Who the players and PCs are: their personalities, descriptors, abilities, and character arcs are certainly going to have an impact on the story. This will inevitably disturb some parts of the setting, and when this happens, you might occasionally feel a small clench forming in your posterior. This is normal. Take a deep breath. Let it out, and unclench your butt. The whole point of having players in the world is precisely so that they can act upon it and bring some element of change to it. Otherwise, there's no story. There's "just a bunch of stuff that happens".

Before, during or after a session, players will express of what is meaningful to them about the PCs, locations, creatures, NPCs, and other aspects of the game in a few ways. For example, if you hear a player say things like the following, they are expressing some measure of meaningfulness about something:

- "I hope…"
- "I want…"
- "I love…"
- "I bet…"
- "What if…"
- "Ugh, I hate…"
- "We have got to…"
- "I have a plan."
- "That was cool."

Take note when this happens. Sometimes, the best idea is to find a way to make something a player said—no matter how offhandedly—become true.

Players also express their sense of meaningfulness through Cypher System mechanics. If a player spends Pool points to use Effort, or spends 1 XP to reroll the die, you have an indicator that what happened meant something to the player—enough to spend something on it. Finding ways to honor those expenditures players engaged with the game, even when the dice—or you—are saying no to something.

In the Cypher System, there are two important ways the game ensures that some amount of narrative power and meaning-making are a shared enterprise: GM intrusions and players intrusions. Intrusions allow either party to grab a hold of the narrative for a moment. The difference between them is that players must pay 1 XP to avoid your GM intrusion, and they only gain XP if you provide it. You can be generous here—after all, you have an infinite amount of XP to give. But don't underestimate the value of give-and-take in _Make-Believe_. It's the original gameplay mechanic: rolling a ball back and forth, playing catch, and learning to share. Ensuring pool points and XP are flowing in and out of the PCs at an acceptable rate is one of the fundamental heartbeats of the Cypher System.

It's not wrong for players to refuse a player intrusion—sometimes you must. But if you're on the fence, consider throwing a little caution to the wind, and finding out what is on the other side of saying yes. Doing so can yield its own reward, and having some narrative responsibility taken off your shoulders can be very freeing, and allow you to be more playful.

Here are a few other strategies to create a sense of shared meaning with players in a campaign:

- Ask the players what features of adventures they enjoy—combat, exploration, social interaction, and puzzle-solving are common answers, but they may have other good ideas for features of gameplay you haven't thought about. When the story reaches a natural stopping point, take some time to ask again.
- Involve the PCs' personal lives, NPCs they know and care about, and address their character arcs when you can.
- Ensure the PCs' decisions have a material impact on the story.
- Tell more than one kind of story. If every session is a dungeon-dive to retrieve one of eight macguffins that ends in a dramatic monster battle, some players might love it. Some will get bored, seeing only slight variations on a theme. Try to vary the length of adventures. Some might take eight sessions, some three, and some might resolve in one.
- Depth and meaning in a setting should be examined from several angles. It's a good idea to change your scope and stakes between adventures, too. Addressing some character arcs might be intimate and personal, some are epic and decisive. Avoid threatening the world or all of existence repeatedly, or dwelling on minutiae.
- Sometimes the best way to subvert player expectations is to let things proceed exactly as the PCs hoped they would.
- Embrace a spirit of not-knowing: this goes both for the players and for GMs. It's not important to have all the answers all the time. The ones you really need will reveal themselves in time, but it's good to preserve a little mystery for another day. Don't overdo this, though—players need a good amount of information to understand and develop good traction with a story.
- Invest each NPC with as much life as you can. They should have real feelings and desires—including a will to survive. Not all of them will survive, and it's okay to feel sad when they don't. GMs are players too, so enjoy every NPC, creature, and gust of wind you become in the course of play.
- When the time is right, revisit those mysteries and unconcluded stories from the past. As the PCs' stories move through time, ask yourself: "What is going on everywhere else that matters?"

### MAKING RULINGS AND PACING THE GAME

In many systems, the GM is given power—and responsibility—to choose ways or times the rules can be applied, bent, or broken—that's still the case in the Cypher System. It's a good idea to be judicious about these powers. Here are some good ways to think about your role in making meaning during the game:

- **Maintain belief and make meaning:** As I mentioned previously, meaningfulness is like gravity, and that gravity must be respected. It grounds the story, and helps define what's at stake in the story. Contradicting yourself for arbitrary reasons will sabotage players' belief in the story and in you, and this kind of mistrust is corrosive to the game of _Make-Believe_. That isn't to say you have to be rigid and make the same rulings all the time—in fact, quite the opposite. Instead, try to make your rulings for the specific situation you are in based on what is meaningful about that specific situation.
    
- **Describe phenomena:** Without you, the PCs don't really have senses. You must provide their sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, temperature, and humidity. To a certain extent also control what PCs know about the world, what they would immediately recognize, or might infer given their experiences. This is tricky—generally, you want to avoid dictating what a player thinks, believes, or feels. You also don't want to produce a feeling of betrayal by lying to a player about the nature of their experiences. That kind of mistrust is corrosive to belief. You can avoid lying to players by describing not what things _are_, but what things _are like_. For example, if the party enters a dark cavern, you might tell the PCS that they notice an uptick in the humidity, a downtick in the temperature, and a gentle white noise far off in the distance. Whether the source of those phenomena end up being a completely natural waterfall, a raging water elemental, or something else entirely, you have avoided lying to the players by equipping them to make their own assumptions about nature of their experiences, and encouraged them to make discoveries as a result of their own choices and actions.
    
- **Call for fewer, more meaningful dice rolls:** When PCs are making relatively inconsequential actions—especially those that are in their character's wheelhouse—into routine actions that require no roll. This requires you to know something about the PC and what's on their character sheet, but you will learn those things in a longer-form game. Only call for a roll when the outcomes would be interesting. Allowing players to proceed confidently with their PC and abilities helps them take more bold or decisive actions rooted in their character, rather than second-guessing each course of action they might Take.
    
- **Let players try things:** Do not fear player actions or dice! If players are being creative with their abilities, that's a good thing—it means they've decided they are meaningful. If you have an outcome you'd like to see in the game, don't call for a roll and then force it even if the outcome wasn't what you wanted. Don't call for roll at all, and propose a GM intrusion instead.
    
- **Keep the story moving forward:** One trap GMs fall into too frequently is to assume that a failed roll results in nothing happening. "Nothing happens" can provide a great occasional dramatic (or comedic) beat—but if you use this as a device too often, the game will slow down to a crawl. Creating meaningful consequences for the results of a roll is usually more interesting than "nothing happens", because it prompts the PCs to take additional action rather than wallow in any negative feelings that came from a "bad roll". If things have slowed down too much, devise and propose a GM intrusion that revitalizes the game's pace or direction.
    
- **Let encounters resolve:** Sometimes players will use a cypher or special ability that causes an encounter to end too quickly for your taste. Take heart—even a foe who has been knocked off a cliff might later claw their way back to the top, reappearing as a GM intrusion. But it is wise to for the moment that doing this will be most meaningful in the story.
    
- **Be a team player:** While you are usually playing the role of a creature or situation that is antagonistic to the PCs, be sure you make some time to also be their head cheerleader—and a fellow player. Don't make yourself an adversary—celebrate their victories, and agonize in their defeats, too. When they have good ideas, tell them so!
    

### HANDLING PLAYERS AND PCS

In the Cypher System, who the players choose for their PCs to be defines the gameplay you can expect to see and find meaning in. For example, a PC with the Drives Like a Maniac focus requires some kind of a vehicle—maybe more than one. Driving a sports car is great—but so is driving a dump truck or an interdimensional tunneler. But if there's nothing to drive, at all, a player has a right to wonder why you allowed them to choose this focus in the first place. A driver with nothing to drive is robbed of meaning, and the player of contributions that would bring meaning to the story.

In the Cypher System, Tier 1 PCs are broadly capable, and some can be incredibly specialized for certain tasks. A PCs' skills, assets, and Effort quite literally make the impossible possible. For example, you've told players to be prepared for tough combat challenges ahead. In response, a player creates a PC who begins the game with 6 Armor:

- +1 Armor from the Tough descriptor;
- +1 Armor from the Adept type's Ward ability, and a shield as one of their pieces of equipment, granting them an asset on Speed defense rolls;
- +4 Armor from the Stands Like a Bastion focus, gaining a set of heavy armor from the Practiced in Armor ability, and an additional bonus for wearing it from the Experienced Defender ability.

Obviously, this PC a defensive powerhouse against conventional attacks—their abilities will only grow as character advancement occurs. That's okay. A PC like this provides an interesting space for you to create dynamic situations only they can withstand. It also creates space for complex encounters that can't be won by fighting so much as endurance, or that require solutions that lean into other PCs' unique talents—or cyphers— can create solutions for. The point is: if a character creates a specialist, don't be afraid to let that specialization shine. There are many ways to challenge a PC—and you always have GM intrusion at your disposal. In a Cypher System campaign, you will be required to create challenges based on the PCs' choices and character arcs.

Moreover, any specialist will have weak points—for example, a character like this needs both hands to use Adept abilities and hold their shield, and every PC is equally vulnerable to GM intrusion. Learning to customize your game for the desired genre, tone, and party composition might mean revisiting the use of some optional rules. For example, if the game requires a little more "gritty realism", employ rules like Fragility and Ironman to dial up the threat.

In the end, _Make-Believe_ is about co-creation of the story. This means that your creativity—and the players'—is much more important than anyone's knowledge of "the rules". Players will sometimes come up with oblique solutions to problems, and in the Cypher System, it's a generally good idea to evaluate those ideas: they are gifts that arrive with meaningfulness already baked in.

Lastly, meaningfulness isn't just about the game or the story. It's also about what you and the players share together as real people, so talk with the players. Talk with them before the game, during the game, and after the game. If something is going well, talk about that! If something isn't going to well, talk about that, too. Be open, honest, and listen carefully to feedback you receive, and try not to take it personally. Don't be afraid to tell other people what your needs and expectations are. Do what you can to meet the needs and expectations of others.

## AN EXAMPLE OF PLAY

Sometimes the best way to learn a game is to observe it being played. This section provides a transcript of a hypothetical group of characters playing through a Cypher System encounter in a Fantasy/Fairy Tale setting with some surreal, Saturday morning cartoon sensibilities. In the example, the party is composed of three Tier 1 PCs with a few character advancements:

- **ORI**, a Naive Speaker who Runs Away
    
    An 8-year old child, and a powerful "dreamer" from the human world, Ori's character arc is Undo a Wrong, because he brought several of his nightmares into this world, where they are wreaking havoc. As part of roleplaying a young child, Ori's player prefers exploration to combat, and almost never attacks a foe directly.
    
- **CHERT**, a Tough Warrior who Abides in Stone
    
    Eleven feet (3.4 m) tall and with a body of durable quartz, Chert took the Aid a Friend character arc when joining Ori on his quest. Chert's player is frequently the life of the party, providing comic relief with her trademark wholesome cluelessness. She also enjoys inflicting and taking damage in combat.
    
- **RENA**, a Mysterious Explorer with Magic Flavor who Masters Spells
    
    As enigmatic as they are ambitious, Rena is a humanoid fox who has been less than forthcoming with their fellow party members about their true motives. Rena's player enjoys solving puzzles, casting spells, and is eager to increase their PC's sorcerous powers through the Master a Skill arc.

### EXPLORING THE SUNKEN LIBRARY

- **GM:**The other end of the portal's tears open with a bright blue light, and the three of you slide into an enormous library. It sprawls away into at least eight different wings. It's dark, too—huge circular windows are set high up along the walls, with thick, bolted brass frames around the edges. What light there is plays in ripples across the high wooden stacks and black marble floors. A shimmering school of a thousand dazzling silver mackerel rush past one of the windows—after they pass, you notice other—larger, darker—shapes in the water. There doesn't seem to be anyone around.
- **RENA:**I want to stabilize this portal to give us more time to explore.
- **GM:**Good thinking! Stabilizing this portal for an hour is a difficulty 4 Intellect task—this one is harder to keep open than the last one. It's already buckling in, like a soda can on the verge of being crushed.

_(This isn't the first portal of this kind the party has been through. Left unattended, they can destabilize and close without warning. Since the players are still new to the game, the GM usually tells them the difficulty of the roll ahead of them.)_

- **RENA:**I'm assuming my Magic Training applies as a skill like last time?
- **GM:**Yeah, it does.
- **ORI:**I want to help, too. Ori takes Rena's loose hand and concentrates on the portal by remembering the beach we were on.
- **RENA:**Thanks. I'm also going to use two levels of Effort. I have 2 Intellect Edge, so that will cost... 5 − 2 = 3 Intellect points from my Pool, but with Ori's help as an asset, I won't have to roll for this at all.
- **ORI:**Worth it! If there's no one to help us find this book, we're going to have to find it on our own.
- **GM:**Stabilizing the portal is going to take about a minute, but the two of you succeed. Chert, what are you doing while they're busy with the portal?
- **CHERT:**I want to take a quick nosy—not far, just want to see if anyone is hiding, and why it's so dark in here. It was the middle of the day, wasn't it?
- **GM:**Yes, it was about midday when you headed into the portal. Checking the place out will also be an Intellect task—no set difficulty here, let's just see what you discover.
- **CHERT:**And I call out—"Hell_oooo_? Is anybody here?" I'm just going to roll it straight... an 8!
- **GM:**You look around, and realize you must be deep underwater. Large, menacing shadows of sea creatures occasionally pass by the windows. There's always a slight creaking from the one wall or another, and occasional droplets of seawater fall from the high ceiling above onto you.Your words are answered only by your own voice echoing through the cavernous chamber, but you do happen upon a fancy card catalog. It's nearly fifteen feet (5 m) tall, with drawers that have been meticulously engraved with all manner of seashells.
- **ORI:**Oh, cool! I skip on over to where Chert is. I bet we can use that to find where the book is! What was it called again?
- **RENA:**Hang on, let me check my notes … it was "1,001 Uses for Peas", by Old Gus. _Yuck_, it sounds awful. Is there a reference or circulation desk?
- **GM:**Yeah, there's a large circular, official-looking desk a short distance away.
- **RENA:**I'll head over there.
- **CHERT:**I lift Ori up so he can reach any drawers he needs to look through.
- **GM:**Ori, if you're looking through the drawers now, it's going to be a difficulty 4 Intellect roll to find the book in the catalog.
- **ORI:**Okay, I'll use one level of Effort, so I pay 3 Intellect points and that makes the difficulty 3.
- **GM:**Cool, so roll a 9!
- **ORI:**… It's a 3. That's not great. I'm going to spend 1 XP to reroll. Oof, it's a 6. This isn't my night for d20 rolls.

_(The GM notices that Ori has a point—the PC's rolls have been a little middling lately, and decides the scene could use a dash of the unexpected. Maybe the library isn't as uninhabited as it looks.)_

- **GM:**Hey, Ori, I have a GM intrusion for you.
- **ORI:**Ori always says yes to XP! Chert, you can have the other XP.
- **CHERT:**Thanks, dude!

_(The group uses colored poker chips to represent Pool points and XP, so the GM passes an XP chip each to Ori and Chert.)_

- **GM:**So, Ori, you're struggling with the card catalog—the cards are all out of order, or upside-down, and it's just chaos in there. Just as you're just starting to make headway, the card catalog lurches, pulling you away from Chert's grasp. You're now dangling precariously off one of the high drawers, and it is sliding out of its framing. What do you do?
- **ORI:**Ori will try to use his weight to slide the drawer back in a little ways, and find a foothold somewhere where a drawer fell out. I still want to find out where the book is!
- **GM:**Okay, give me a Might roll. The difficulty is 4.
- **ORI:**Does Ori's skill with climbing count for this?
- **GM:**Sure, it's basically a very aggressive climbing wall right now—difficulty 3, so roll a 9.
- **ORI:**… 14. Ori hangs on for dear life, and I want to activate Go Defensive.
- **CHERT:**Hang on, buddy! I'll save you from this …
- **RENA:**… Evil furniture!?

_(The GM takes a few moments to create a new creature—the Crabby Hermit.)_

---

#### CRABBY HERMIT4 (12)

- **Motive:** Solitude, survival.
    
- **Environment:** Underwater
    
- **Health:** 18
    
- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Armor:** 2
    
- **Movement:** Short; short when swimming
    
- **Modifications:** Crushing, breaking, and grappling as level 5; Speed defense as level 3 due to size
    
- **Combat:** Can attack twice, once with each claw.
    
- **Interaction:** The crabby hermit can be reasoned with if it is humiliated or becomes demoralized.
    
- **Loot:** If the crabby hermit is slain or leaves the card catalog, it leaves behind three cyphers: a Seashell of Instant Shelter, a Pearl Necklace of Giant Size, and a Mermaid Tear
    

_(The crabby hermit isn't difficult to hit, but it will be tough with only two combatants. Unless Chert and Rena decide to expend a fair amount of Effort to damage, the crab will probably be defeated by morale conditions rather than depletion of all of its health. The GM trusts Ori or Rena to come up with a plan, or to use one of their cyphers.)_

---

### COMBAT

- **GM:**As the card catalog finishes rounding its turn, several drawers clatter to the floor, and legs emerge from them. and you can make out Ori's dangling silhouette hanging off one side. A large wooden flap opens, and two eyestalks protrude, followed by the two massive pincer claws—it's an enormous hermit crab, and it _does not look happy_, so roll initiative, everybody! That's a Speed task, and the difficulty is 4—so you need to roll a 12, but Ori is hindered from being spun around—you're just a little bit dizzy, so this is difficulty 5 for you—you need to roll a 15.
- **CHERT:**I'm going to put a level of Effort in to lower that target number to a 9, and I rolled … a 10. Phew! Expensive, but worth it in this case.
- **RENA:**I rolled a 13.
- **ORI:**Ori rolled a 13, too—doesn't beat a difficulty 5, though.
- **GM:**Okay, Rena, Chert: the initiative is yours.
- **CHERT:**I'll go first—I just want to get up in this thing's face, and try to guard against it grabbing or attacking Ori.
- **RENA:**I attack the crab with my bow. Is this thing level 4?
- **GM:**It's large, so it's only a difficulty 3 to hit it. The target number is 9.
- **RENA:**A 17! That hits, so I inflict 4 damage for my longbow, +1 for the special roll, for a total of 5 damage.

_(Rena's longbow is a medium weapon—The GM notes that Crabby Hermit takes only 3 damage due to its Armor.)_

- **GM:**Your arrow sails across the still air of the library and sticks into the crab's thick armor plates, sending hairline fractures in all directions on one of its forelegs.
- **RENA:**Did I do any damage?
- **GM:**You did, but this thing definitely has some Armor. And now it's the crab's turn: It rears up on its legs and tries to grab Ori with one of its claws—It bellows out at you all: "You are _way too loud!_ Get out of my library!"
- **CHERT:**But I'm guarding him!
- **GM:**Oh yeah—that will be an eased Speed task to prevent the attack. So, difficulty 3. Roll a 9.
- **CHERT:**… Uh oh. It's a 1.
- **ORI:**Oh no …
- **CHERT:**Hey, if I can't guard against the attack, could I take the attack instead as my GM intrusion?

_(The GM pauses to think. Is there a rule for this? What Chert suggested sounds cool, and keeping Ori out of direct combat is definitely in keeping with the spirit of the game and her character. The GM decides to accept.)_

- **GM:**Well, it'll take your next action to do that, and the crab is going to hit you harder, is that cool?
- **CHERT:**… I take the attack.
- **GM:**Okay, here's how that happens: You miscalculate—the crab wasn't reaching up for Ori, it was actually winding up a punch targeted at Chert, so you are surprised when its claw rushes toward your face.Rena, your fox ears hear a faint _sonic boom_ as the punch lands, sending Chert flying 20 feet (6 m) across the room, crashing into the sea of abandoned tables and chairs. The sound of splintering wood echoes throughout the chamber. All told, you take 11 damage to your Might Pool, Chert.
- **CHERT:**Okay, I have 5 Armor. 11 − 5 = 6 Might points is what I lose.
- **RENA:**Yikes. You okay?
- **GM:**You also gain 2 XP for your Aid a Friend character arc, Chert, for the full bodyguard treatment.
- **CHERT:**Oh, I can take it for 2 XP! Since I can't take an action this turn, I am just going to twitch my left leg dramatically to let Rena and Ori know I'm still alive. This crab's got nothing once I get back up.

_(For a tier 1 PC, Chert is a very specialized, with several sources of Armor: a set of stone heavy armor she wears provides +3 Armor, +1 from her Tough descriptor, and +1 from her Golem Body. As a result of all of this, Chert doesn't put Effort into Speed rolls, especially defense rolls—this kind of durability is just part of being a big rock monster.)_

- **GM:**With its other claw, the hermit crab—or maybe it's a mantis shrimp now?—launches a heavy wooden armchair in your direction, Rena. That's a Speed roll, difficulty 4 to avoid.
- **RENA:**I'm still behind the circulation desk, aren't I? Can I use that as cover?
- **GM:**Yeah, that'll ease the difficulty from 4 to 3—roll me a 9.
- **RENA:**… 14! I'll take it.
- **GM:**Okay, the chair sails safely overhead! It's your turn again. Chert still recovering from that haymaker—kelpmaker? Either way, Ori and Rena have an action to choose.
- **ORI:**Ori is still just hanging on and digging through the drawers that haven't fallen out. I want to use my Understanding ability on it so I can find the book!
- **GM:**Ori is just rifling through the cards up there, got it.
- **RENA:**Okay, I have an idea. I'm going to activate a cypher: my Darning Needle, and I rush this thing.
- **GM:**You're a short distance away, so it'll be a difficulty 4 Speed task to move and still have time to attack the crab—and it's still a difficulty 3 to hit. Also, using a cypher is normally an Intellect roll, but since this requires a melee attack, you must use either Might or Speed for the task.
- **RENA:**I'm going to use a level of Effort … 10. I run over there! I'll use Might for my attack roll … oh, a 20!
- **ORI:**Awesome—wait, what does that cypher do?
- **GM:**Oh, wow! So, your 4 damage just barely gets through this thing's armor, but it's enough to deal some damage—and you see it start to shrink down from to the Darning Needle's magic. Do you want the extra +4 damage, or to choose a major effect?
- **RENA:**Can I shrink the crab even more as a major effect? I want this thing to be _puny_.
- **GM:**Ha ha, okay, let's say it's about Ori's size now. The wood flap on the card catalog swings shut, and the whole card catalog settles down onto the floor. It's a much smoother ride for Ori, who is still riding on top of the card catalogue.
- **CHERT:**Whoa, cool.
- **GM:**Okay. It's technically the crab's turn, but I'm going to say it spends its turn hiding in the card catalog. It appears the immediate threat of combat has faded.
- **CHERT:**Nice, can I take a turn now?
- **GM:**Yeah, Chert you stand back up and clear your head. What do you do?

---

### CONCLUSION

- **CHERT:**I march back over there and I want to pull this crab or shrimp or whatever he is out of this card catalog.
- **GM:**Okay. It doesn't say that the Darning Needle's shrinking hinders the target's Might tasks, but I'm going to ease this for you by two steps anyway in honor of the extra shrinkage from Rena's natural 20. So, it'll only be a difficulty 3 to yank this thing out of its home.
- **CHERT:**I have +3 Might Edge, so that pays for one level of Effort … I rolled an 8, so I succeed.

_(Again, Chert's unique PC pays off here—She has 1 Might Edge from being a Warrior, +1 from Golem Body, and +1 from a character advancement she purchased, and she isn't even Tier 2 yet.)_

- **GM:**The crab is wriggling in a vain attempt to get free. It's shrieking "You can't do this to me!"
- **CHERT:**Can I propose a player intrusion? Is it possible there's a door, airlock, or tube I could toss it out of?
- **GM:**Sure, tell us how you show it the door, and give me that XP.
- **CHERT:**I just open the main doors—and there's probably a wall of ocean water there that doesn't rush in at all—and I say "Hit the road, Jack!", and boot the crab out the door. The water just stays like a wall at the door, and I calmly just close the door again, and dust off my hands.
- **RENA:**Ha! I love it.
- **ORI:**Good riddance!
- **GM:**Ori, if you want to try one last time to find the book in the cart catalog, you do have to apply a level of Effort because you're retrying a task, but you also have that asset from using Understanding. With both of those in play, it's going to be a difficulty 2 Intellect task, so you only need to roll a 6 this time.
- **ORI:**… 10, but that's a success! Ori proudly shows the index card to his friends, but I think it's time Ori uses his one-action recovery roll … I recover 3 Pool points.
- **RENA:**Yeah, me too … I recover 6 points.
- **CHERT:**We should search this card catalog, see if the crab left anything behind, but I need a little bit longer to rest. We should still have at least 10 minutes left on the portal for me to make a recovery roll, right?
- **GM:**Oh, yeah, you have plenty of time. What are Ori and Rena doing while Chert is resting?
- **ORI:**Let's go get the book!
- **RENA:**I'll help look and make sure nothing else jumps out at us. If it does, we run right back here, okay? We can search the card catalog when we get back, I guess.
- **GM:**With both of you looking, the index card, and a better understanding of the library's filing system, I'm going to say you find the book on a high shelf. Ori, you have to climb a pretty precarious-looking wooden ladder to get to it, and it's a cartoonishly large and heavy tome, but there it is—"1,001 Uses for Peas". It has long, heavy, leather binding straps on it.
- **ORI:**We did it! Can I wear the book like a big backpack using those straps?
- **GM:**Sure, why not?
- **CHERT:**Okay let's search that secret compartment in the card catalog!
- **ORI:**I'll climb in there and start looking around.
- **GM:**Okay, the two of you return with your prize to where Chert is finishing her rest. Searching that will be a difficulty 3 Intellect task.
- **ORI:**… a 16!
- **GM:**Nice. Each of you gains 1 XP for discovering that the library was not abandoned, for dealing with the crabby hermit, and for locating the book in the card catalogue. and here are the three cyphers Ori finds. There's no identification roll needed for these, as they are all labeled with trustworthy-looking, tidy handwriting.

_(The GM hands out three cards from a cypher deck, and collects Rena's expended Darning Needle cypher card.)_

- **RENA:**Ooh, I have enough XP to advance to Tier 2! Time to finally increase my Pools!
- **GM:**Cool, let's take a short break while you distribute those new cyphers among yourselves, and we'll give Rena a few minutes to choose four new abilities from their Explorer type or Magic Flavor.
