(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 252)

For our purposes, fantasy is any genre that has magic, or something so inexplicable it might as well be magic. The sort of core default of this type is Tolkienesque fantasy, also known as second-world fantasy because it includes a completely new world not our own. Big fantasy epics like those penned by J. R. R. Tolkien (hence the name), C. S. Lewis, George R. R. Martin, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Eddings, Ursula K. Le Guin, and others are indicative of this genre. It usually involves swords, sorcery, nonhuman species (such as elves, dwarves, helborn, and half-giants), and epic struggles.

Of course, fantasy might also involve the modern world, with creatures of myth and sorcerers dwelling among us. It might involve mythic traditions of any number of cultures (elves, dwarves, and the like, usually being decidedly European) or bear little resemblance to anything on Earth, past or present. It might even involve some of the trappings of science fiction, with spaceships and laser guns amid the wizardry and swords (this is often called science fantasy).

Fantasy can also be defined by the amount of fantasy elements within it. A second-world fantasy filled with wizards, ghosts, dragons, curses, and gods is referred to as high fantasy. Fantasy with a firmer grounding in reality as we know it in our world is low fantasy. (In fact, low fantasy often takes place in our world, or in our world's distant past, like the stories of Conan.) No single element indicates concretely that a given fantasy is high or low. It's the prevalence of those elements.

The point is, there are many, many types of fantasy.

Some of these options recommend swapping out a type ability for an ability from one of the character flavors such as combat, magic, or stealth.

### ALCHEMIST

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

In the sense that an alchemist is someone who makes magical items or similar types of things, Adept and Explorer are appropriate type choices for academic alchemists. For a general sort of alchemist who makes potions of magical effects, choose the Masters Spells focus (instead of spells, you learn potions). For one who transforms into a powerful and dangerous creature, choose Howls at the Moon. For one who loves throwing bombs, choose Bears a Halo of Fire. For a healer, choose Works Miracles.

### ASSASSIN/SPY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

Explorer and Warrior are good type choices for an assassin character. Appropriate foci are Masters Weaponry, Moves Like a Cat, Murders, and Works the Back Alleys.

### BARBARIAN

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

A barbarian character is probably a Warrior or (to focus a little more on skills than combat) an Explorer. Good foci to choose from are Lives in the Wilderness, Masters Weaponry, Needs No Weapon, Never Says Die, Performs Feats of Strength, and Rages.

### BARD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

Bards in fantasy fiction and games are troubadours, minstrels, and storytellers, perhaps with a supernatural element. Bards are usually Explorers or Speakers. Appropriate foci are Entertains, Helps Their Friends, Infiltrates, and Masters Spells.

### CLERIC OR PRIEST

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

Academic clerics are usually Adepts or Speakers, but martial clerics are often Warriors (perhaps with magic flavor). For a typical cleric with a versatile set of abilities, choose the Channels Divine Blessings focus.

- **Cleric (death):** Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits
    
- **Cleric (knowledge):** Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Would Rather Be Reading
    
- **Cleric (life):** Defends the Weak, Shepherds the Community, Works Miracles
    
- **Cleric (light):** Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings
    
- **Cleric (storm):** Rides the Lightning, Thunders
    
- **Cleric (trickery):** Takes Animal Shape (also see options for rogues)
    
- **Cleric (war):** Masters Weaponry (also see options for fighters)
    

### DRUID

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 21)

As a very specific sort of nature priest, a druid character is usually an Adept or Explorer (in either case probably using the magic flavor). A typical druid probably has Channels Divine Blessings or Lives in the Wilderness as a focus, but for more specific options, see the following foci:

- **Druid (animal companion):** Controls Beasts, Masters the Swarm
    
- **Druid (elemental):** Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
    
- **Druid (nature affinity):** Speaks for the Land
    
- **Druid (transformation):** Abides in Stone, Takes Animal Shape, Walks the Wild Woods
    

### FIGHTER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 21)

Fighters almost always have the Warrior type, but some are Explorers. A typical fighter probably has a direct focus like Masters Weaponry or Wields an Enchanted Weapon. For additional options based on choosing a specific fighting role, see the following:

- **Fighter (guardian):** Brandishes an Exotic Shield, Defends the Gate, Masters Defense, Never Says Die, Stands Like a Bastion
    
- **Fighter (melee):** Fights Dirty, Fights With Panache, Looks For Trouble, Needs No Weapon, Wields Two Weapons at Once
    
- **Fighter (ranged):** Is Licensed to Carry, Throws With Deadly Accuracy
    

### GUNSLINGER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 21)

A gunslinger is probably a Warrior or Explorer, but some are Speakers with combat flavor. Appropriate foci are Is Licensed to Carry, Masters Weaponry, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon.

### INQUISITOR

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 21)

Inquisitors are usually Explorers, Speakers, or Warriors, depending on whether their inclinations are for having many skills, being good at interacting with people, or combat. Appropriate foci are Infiltrates, Metes Out Justice, and Operates Undercover.

### MERCHANT

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 21)

An Explorer with a focus dealing with social interactions, like Entertains or Leads, would make a good merchant character, but the more obvious choice would be a Speaker.

### MONK OR MARTIAL ARTIST

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 22)

As masters of unarmed combat, monks are usually Warriors or Explorers (perhaps with a combat flavor). Appropriate foci are Fights With Panache, Needs No Weapon, and Throws With Deadly Accuracy.

### PALADIN/HOLY KNIGHT/PARAGON

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 22)

As holy warriors who mix martial prowess and magic, paladins are usually Warriors or Explorers (in either case, perhaps modified with the magic flavor). Good foci for this type of character include Defends the Gate, Defends the Weak, Metes Out Justice, Slays Monsters, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon.

### RANGER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 22)

Rangers mix combat and skills, and therefore are usually Explorers (perhaps with combat flavor) or Warriors (perhaps with skills and knowledge flavor). Appropriate foci for a ranger are Controls Beasts, Hunts, Lives in the Wilderness, Slays Monsters, Throws With Deadly Accuracy, and Wields Two Weapons at Once.

### ROGUE OR THIEF

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 22)

Most rogue-type characters are Explorers, but an interaction-focused rogue could easily be a Speaker (perhaps with stealth flavor). Good foci for rogues are Explores Dark Places, Fights Dirty, Hunts, Infiltrates, Is Wanted by the Law, Moves Like a Cat, Sailed Beneath the Jolly Roger, and Works the Back Alleys.

### SORCERER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 22)

Sorcerers, for our purpose here, are mages who have inherent magical abilities (as opposed to wizards, who study long and hard to get their spells). Most sorcerers are Adepts, but some are Explorers or Speakers. The Masters Spells focus gives a typical sorcerer an effective set of abilities, and most foci choices provide a themed set of spells. For sorcerers of various magical bloodlines, see the following:

- **Sorcerer (angel):** Blazes With Radiance, Channels Divine Blessings, Keeps a Magic Ally
    
- **Sorcerer (destiny):** Descends From Nobility, Was Foretold
    
- **Sorcerer (dragon):** Bears a Halo of Fire, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
    
- **Sorcerer (elemental):** Abides in Stone, Bears a Halo of Fire, Employs Magnetism, Moves Like the Wind, Rides the Lightning, Wears a Sheen of Ice
    
- **Sorcerer (fey):** Takes Animal Shape
    
- **Sorcerer (fiend):** Bears a Halo of Fire, Keeps a Magic Ally
    
- **Sorcerer (undead):** Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits
    

### TRICKSTER OR CON ARTIST

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

These clever folks are typically Speakers, although they could be Adepts if they are very magical (or Explorers if they aren't magical at all). Foci choices include Fights Dirty, Works the Back Alleys, or Entertains.

### WAR-WIZARD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

For those unusual characters who use a mix of weapon attacks and spells, play a Warrior with magic flavor, an Adept with combat flavor, or an Explorer with magic flavor. Appropriate foci include Fights With Panache, Masters Weaponry, and Wields an Enchanted Weapon.

**Editor's Notes â€”** This description corrects a misprint of a non-existent "Expert" type.

### WARLOCK OR WITCH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

For the purposes of this list, warlocks and witches are mages who gain magical power from pacts they make with otherworldly entities. Most warlocks are Adepts, but Explorers and Speakers (perhaps with magic flavor) can be interesting options. Fun foci for a warlock include Dances With Dark Matter, Keeps a Magic Ally, Masters the Swarm, Separates Mind From Body, and Was Foretold, but (depending on the patron and pact) most sorcerer and wizard foci work just as well.

### WILD MAGE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

Those who use chaotic magic are usually Adepts, but a dabbler might be an Explorer or Speaker with the magic flavor. The best focus that suits this theme is Uses Wild Magic.

### WIZARD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 20)

For the purposes of this list, wizards study magical lore at length to learn the ways of spellcasting (as opposed to sorcerers, warlocks, and so on). Wizards are usually Adepts, but a person-oriented wizard might be a Speaker (perhaps with the magic flavor). For a generalist wizard who has a variety of spells, choose the Masters Spells focus. For more specific kinds of wizards, see the following:

- **Wizard (abjurer):** Absorbs Energy, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Wears a Sheen of Ice
    
- **Wizard (conjurer or summoner):** Controls Beasts, Keeps a Magic Ally
    
- **Wizard (diviner):** Learns Quickly, Sees Beyond, Separates Mind From Body, Solves Mysteries
    
- **Wizard (enchanter):** Commands Mental Powers, Leads
    
- **Wizard (evoker):** Bears a Halo of Fire, Blazes With Radiance, Rides the Lightning, Thunders, Wears a Sheen of Ice
    
- **Wizard (illusionist):** Awakens Dreams, Crafts Illusions
    
- **Wizard (necromancer):** Consorts With the Dead, Shepherds Spirits
    
- **Wizard (transmuter):** Controls Gravity, Focuses Mind Over Matter, Takes Animal Shape

In a high fantasy setting, some GMs may want dwarves and elves to be mechanically different from humans. Below are some possibilities for how this might work.

**Editor's Notes â€”** The Species as Descriptor section is worth reading before deciding what will work best for your game. Additional ideas for fantasy species descriptors are available from Old Gus' Daft Drafts.

### CATFOLK

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 86)

You are unmistakably feline. Your people have fur; large, pointed ears; sharp teeth and claws; and even tails. You are nimble, graceful, and quick. An ancient and sophisticated culture, your people have their own language, customs, and traditions developed in relative seclusion over the centuries. Neither conquerors nor conquered, the success of your society has come from the fact that you have given most others a wide berth. As a people, you almost never get involved in wars or similar matters, which has given other cultures the idea that you are aloof, unapproachable, or mysterious. As long as they leave you alone, what they think is fine with you.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Agile:** +4 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in climbing and balance tasks.
    
- **Bared Claws:** Even unarmed, your claws are light weapons that inflict 4 points of damage.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You were curious as to what the other PCs were up to.
2. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same direction as you.
3. You are interested in making a profit, and the other PCs seem to have a lead on doing just that.
4. It seemed like a lark.

### DRAGONFOLK

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 87)

You have scales, fangs, claws, and magicâ€”gifts of the dragons. You might have been born of dragonfolk parents, willingly transformed in a magical ceremony, or chosen by a dragon to be their agent or champion. You have a great destiny before you, but it is your choice whether to make it your own or bend to the will of those who made you what you are. Some people mistrust or fear you, and others consider you a prophet or wish to exploit your power for their own goals.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Sturdy:** +2 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in intimidation.
    
- **Dragonbreath (3 Might points):** You breathe out a blast of energy in an immediate area. Choose one type of energy (arcane, cold, fire, thorn, and so on); the blast inflicts 2 points of damage of this kind of energy (ignores Armor) to all creatures or objects within the area. Because this is an area attack, adding Effort to increase your damage works differently than it does for single-target attacks. If you apply a level of Effort to increase the damage, add 2 points of damage for each target, and even if you fail your attack roll, all targets in the area still take 1 point of damage. Action.
    
- **Draconic Resistance:** You gain +2 Armor against the type of energy you create with your dragonbreath.
    
- **Scaly:** +1 to Armor.

2. You needed to get out of town, and the PCs were going in the same direction as you.
3. Your creator, master, or mentor told you to help the PCs.
4. You want to make a name for yourself, and the other PCs seem competent and compatible.

### DWARF

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 258)

You're a stocky, broad-shouldered, bearded native of the mountains and hills. You're also as stubborn as the stone in which the dwarves carve their homes under the mountains. Tradition, honor, pride in smithcraft and warcraft, and a keen appreciation of the wealth buried under the roots of the world are all part of your heritage. Those who wish you ill should be wary of your temper. When dwarves are wronged, they never forget.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Stalwart:** +2 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in Might defense rolls.

2. The PCs hired you to dig out the entrance to a buried ruin.
3. You tracked down the thieves of your ancestor's tomb and found they were the PCs. Instead of killing them, you joined them.
4. Before dwarves settle down, they need to see the world.

### ELF

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 258)

You haunt the woodlands and deep, natural realms, as your people have for millennia. You are the arrow in the night, the shadow in the glade, and the laughter on the wind. As an elf, you are slender, quick, graceful, and long lived. You manage the sorrows of living well past many mortal lifetimes with song, wine, and an appreciation for the deep beauties of growing things, especially trees, which can live even longer than you do.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Agile:** +2 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Long-Lived:** Your natural lifespan (unless tragically cut short) is thousands of years.
    
- **Skill:** You are specialized in tasks related to perception.
    
- **Skill:** You are practiced in using one bow variety of your choice.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in stealth tasks. In areas of natural woodland, you are specialized in stealth tasks.

4. An adventure was in the offing, and you didn't want to be left behind.

### GNOME

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 88)

You are curious and love discovering ways to turn found things into art, tools, or weapons. You might be a sculptor, smith, artist, chef, storyteller, or inventor. Alchemy, magic, and engineering fascinate you. Other beings may see you as a strange mix of a nature-loving elf and a craft-obsessed dwarf, but you and your kind are unique people with a passion for life, exploration, and creation.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Genius:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in two skills that suit your creative nature, such as alchemy, smithing, poetry, cooking, woodcarving, or pottery.

2. You were recruited because of your knowledge on a particular subject.
3. You were bored and it sounded like the PCs were going to do something interesting.
4. You owe one of the PCs a favor for a useful gift in the past.

### HALF-GIANT

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 259)

You stand at least 12 feet (4 m) tall and tower over everyone around you. Whether you are a full-blooded giant or merely have giant heritage from large ancestors, you're massive. Always large for your age, it became an issue only once you reached puberty and topped 7 feet (2 m) in height, and kept growing from there.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Tough:** +4 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Mass and Strength:** You inflict +1 point of damage with your melee attacks and attacks with thrown weapons.

### HALFLING

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 89)

Three feet tall and proud, you are fond of the comforts of home but itching for a little adventure now and then. Small and quick, you have a way of getting along with everyone. You might have been raised in a halfling village, a mixed community where humans and the small folk work and eat side by side as friends, or a less welcoming environment where your people get things done using deception and criminal activity. You and humans have a lot in commonâ€”you're just more compact and efficient about it.

You gain the following characteristics:

3. You were tricked into going with the other PCs or were brought along despite your very reasonable objections.
4. You're very protective of another PC and want to make sure they get through the upcoming challenges.

### HELBORN

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 259)

Demons of the underworld sometimes escape. When they do, they can taint human bloodlines. Things like you are the result of such unnatural unions. Part human and part something else, you are an orphan of a supernatural dalliance. Thanks to your unsettling appearance, you've probably been forced to make your own way in a world that often fears and resents you. Some of your kin have large horns, tails, and pointed teeth. Others are more subtle or more obvious in their differencesâ€”a shadow of a knife-edge in their face and a touch that withers normal plants, a little too much fire in their eyes and a scent of ash in the air, a forked tongue, goatlike legs, or the inability to cast a shadow. Work with the GM on your particular helborn appearance.

You gain the following characteristics.

- **Devious:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in tasks related to magic lore and lore of the underworld.
    
- **Fire Adapted:** +2 to Armor against damage from fire only.

- **Inner Evil:** You sometimes lose control and risk hurting your allies. When you roll a 1, the GM has the option to intrude by indicating that you lose control. Once you've lost control, you attack any and every living creature within short range. You can't spend Intellect points for any reason other than to try to regain control (a difficulty 2 task). After you regain control, you suffer a âˆ’1 penalty to all rolls for one hour.
    
- **Inability:** People distrust you. Tasks to persuade or deceive are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You were nearly beaten to death by people who didn't like your look, but the PCs found and revived you.
2. The PCs hired you for your knowledge of magic.
3. Every so often you get visions of people trapped in the underworld. You tracked those people down and found the PCs, who'd never visited the underworld. Yet.
4. Your situation at home became untenable because of how people reacted to your looks. You joined the PCs to get away.

### LIZARDFOLK

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 89)

You are from a long line of fierce reptilian predators. You show your fangs and scales proudly. Your people survive and thrive in the wetlands, guarding their eggs, raising their hatchlings, and protecting their territory. City-builders may call you a savage and your culture primitive, but there is grace in your hunting, artistry in your crafting, joy in your songs, and reverence in your worship.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Agile:** +2 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Skill:** You are trained in balancing, jumping, and swimming.

- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.

2. Something has been attacking your community and you want to find and destroy it.
3. You were exiled from your community and need to prove your worthiness before you can return to it.

## OPTIONAL RULE: SPELLCASTING

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 259)

Fantasy settings prioritize magic as an essential ingredient. But why restrict that magic to just wizards and similar characters? It's not uncommon in fantasy literature for a thief or warrior to learn a few spells as they steal or brawl through their adventures. Leiber's Gray Mouser knew some spells, Moorcock's Elric knew a lot, pretty much everyone in Anthony's Xanth books knew at least one, and so on. Of course, wizards and sorcerers specialize in spellcasting, which gives them clear superiority in magic use. But whether a character is a fireball-flinging wizard or a belligerent barbarian, anyone can learn some spellcasting under this optional rule.

Under the spellcasting rule, any character, no matter their role or type, can choose to learn a spell as a long-term benefit. After they learn one spell, they may learn more later if they wish, or just stick with the one.

### FIRST SPELL

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 260)

Any character can gain a spell by spending 3 XP and working with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the PC learned it. Maybe they learned it as a child from their parent and practiced it enough to actually do it; perhaps they spent a month hiding in a wizard's library reading; it could be that they found a weird magical amulet that imbues them with the spell; and so on.

Next, choose one low-tier ability from Chapter 9: : Abilities. If the GM agrees it is appropriate, the character gains that ability as their spell, with a few caveats. The spell can't be used like a normal ability gained through a PC's type or focus. Instead, a character must either use a recovery roll or spend many minutes or longer evoking their spell, in addition to paying its Pool cost (if any).

- **Using a Recovery Roll to Cast a Spell:** If the character uses a one-action, ten-minute, or one-hour recovery roll as part of the same action to cast the spell (including paying any Pool costs), they can use the ability as an action. This represents a significant mental and physical drain on the character, because the normal benefit of recovering points in a Pool is not gained.
    
- **Spending Time to Cast a Spell:** If the character takes at least ten minutes chanting, mumbling occult phonemes, concentrating deeply, or otherwise using all their actions, they can cast a low-tier spell (if they also pay any Pool costs). An hour is required to cast mid-tier spells. Ten hours are required to cast a high-tier spell.
    

### MORE SPELLS

Once a character has learned at least one spell, they can opt to learn additional spells later. Each time, they must spend an additional 3 XP and work with the GM to come up with an in-game story of how the character's magical learning has progressed.

Two additional rules for learning additional spells apply:

- First, a character must be at least tier 3 and have previously gained one low-tier spell before they can learn a mid-tier spell.
- Second, a character must be at least tier 5 and have previously gained one mid-tier spell before they can learn a high-tier spell.

**Editor's Notes â€”** For more on low-, mid-, and high-tier abilities, see Chapter 9: : Abilities.

Otherwise, gaining and casting additional spells are as described for the character's first spell.

### PREPARED VS. SPONTANEOUS SPELLCASTING

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 260)(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 23)

Magical characters get their abilities (which might be spells, rituals, or something else) from their type and focus, and they can use these abilities as they see fit as long as they spend the required Pool points. This technically makes them more like spontaneous casters.

Wizards (usually Adepts) and characters with explicit spellcasting foci like Masters Spells, Channels Divine Blessings, Speaks for the Land, and possibly others are also considered to be spellcasters, and moreover, specialized ones. Their spellsâ€”abilities provided by their type or focusâ€”are used simply by paying their Pool costs. Extra time or physical effort isn't required to cast them. That's because, in the parlance of the fantasy genre, these spells are considered to be "prepared."

But specialized casters can also use the optional spellcasting rule to expand their magic further. They can learn additional spells via the optional spellcasting rule just like other characters, with the same limitations.

Optionally, specialized casters who record their arcane knowledge in a spellbook (or something similar) gain one additional benefit. The spellbook is a compilation of spells, formulas, and notes that grants the specialized caster more flexibility than those who've simply learned a spell or two. With a spellbook, a PC can replace up to three prepared spells with three other spells they've learned of the same tier. To do so, they must spend at least one uninterrupted hour studying their spellbook. Usually, this is something that requires a fresh mind, and must be done soon after a ten-hour recovery.

For instance, if a wizard exchanges Ward (an ability gained from their type) with Telekinesis (an ability gained from the optional spellcasting rule), from now on the character can cast Ward only by spending time or using a recovery roll (as well as spending Pool points). On the other hand, they can use Telekinesis normally, because now it's prepared. Later, the wizard could spend the time studying to change out their prepared spells with others they've learned using the optional spellcasting rule.

A PC might choose the 4 XP character advancement option to select a new type-based ability from their tier or a lower tier. If so, the ability gained doesn't count as a spell, and the spellcasting rule limitations do not apply to the ability so gained. If the PC is a wizard and uses the 4 XP character advancement option, treat the ability as one more prepared spell.

## MYSTICAL MARTIAL ARTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 68)

If the setting calls for wuxia-style fantasy martial arts or similar types of action, you can make a few rule changes to portray the kinds of things characters in such stories can accomplish.

- **Running and climbing speeds and jumping distances are doubled.** For those trained in running, climbing, or jumping, the speeds and distances are tripled instead of doubled. For those specialized, they are quintupled. For all intents and purposes, this means that everyone can run up a wall or jump very high in the air, and masters can practically fly or run across water.
    
- **Everyone knows kung fu.** Unless a person is a simple farmer, herder, or merchant, they know how to fight with elaborate and powerful martial arts styles. This doesn't change anything in the game mechanicallyâ€”no one gets the ability to use weapons that they wouldn't normally have under the rules. But it does change the flavor, suggesting that no PC is entirely ignorant of weapons or close combat.
    
- **Players are encouraged to come up with interesting names for their martial arts abilities.** Instead of using a Bash attack, perhaps it is "The Three-Flower Fist," and instead of Fury, a character uses "The Rage of the Sevenfold." It is reasonable for high-tier martial abilities such as Amazing Effort, Jump Attack, or Finishing Blow to be described with a magical flareâ€” blazing auras of fire, brilliant cascades of light, ethereal figures overlaying the character, and so on.
    
- **Materials and objects are easier to destroy.** For the purpose of attacking objects, subtract 2 from the level of any material (minimum of 0). It should be relatively simple for any character to smash through a plain wooden door with little effort, and true warriors can shatter stones with their blows.
    
- **Wounds heal faster.** Everyone gains +1 to all recovery rolls.
    
- **Superhuman abilities exist.** Consider adopting some of the superhero rules from the Cypher System Reference Document, in particular the Power Shifts optional rule. These may derive from almost supernatural levels of training in various techniques (such as dianxue) but probably mostly from neili.
    

Dianxue

 

The touch of deathâ€”killing by using precise nonlethal force on key points of the body.

Neili

 

Internal forceâ€” building up and cultivating the energy known as qi and using it for supernatural effects.

## CRAFTING MAGIC ITEMS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 49)

Potions, scrolls, and other one-use items are cyphers, and longer-lasting items are generally artifacts.

### CRAFTING CYPHERS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 50)

- **1. Choose Cypher Level.** Creating a low-level cypher is easier than creating a high-level one. The character decides what level of cypher they're trying to create, which must be in the level range for the cypher as listed in the Cypher System Reference Document. Note that some cyphers have the same effect no matter what level they are, so the character could make crafting easier by creating the lowest-level version of that cypher, but the GM is always able to rule that a particular cypher must be crafted at a certain level or higher for it to work. In particular, a stim is very strong for its level range, and should always be treated as a level 6 cypher when crafted by a PC.
    
- **2. Determine Materials.** Just as crafting an axe requires iron and wood, crafting a magical cypher requires strange and exotic materialsâ€”powdered gems, ink from monsters, mysterious herbs, and so on. The level of the cypher determines how expensive these materials are, according to the following table.
    

Crafting Cyphers Material Costs

|Cypher Level|Materials Cost|
|---|---|
|1|One inexpensive item|
|2|Two inexpensive items|
|3|One moderate item|
|4|Two moderate items|
|5|Three moderate items|
|6|One expensive item|
|7|Two expensive items|
|8|Three expensive items|
|9|One very expensive item|
|10|Two very expensive items|

- **3. Assess Difficulty.** The difficulty of a magic item crafting task is always equal to 1 + the level of the cypher. The crafter can reduce the assessed difficulty of a crafting task with skill training (such as being trained or specialized in brewing potions or scribing scrolls), assets, special abilities provided by their focus or type, and so on. Using a formula, recipe, or other guideline for a specific cypher counts as an asset for this purpose. Because this is an activity requiring special knowledge, it is not possible for a character with no skill (or with an inability in this skill) to do this sort of crafting; the character cannot attempt the task at all.
    
- **4. Determine Time to Craft.** The amount of time it takes to craft a magical cypher is determined by the assessed difficulty, so decreasing the assessed difficulty not only means the character is more likely to succeed, but also that they have to spend less time on crafting it. See the table below.
    
    For any time in excess of nine hours, the process is assumed to have stages where the character is not actively working on it, just checking on it occasionally to make sure everything is going as plannedâ€” allowing the base ingredients of a potion to cook for a few hours, stirring to make sure the ingredients don't congeal, allowing ink on a scroll to dry, and so on. In other words, the character is able to perform other actions in the vicinity of the crafting (such as studying, resting, eating, and so on), but couldn't craft on the road or in the middle of a dungeon.
    

Crafting Magic Items Difficulty and Time

|Assessed Difficulty|Time to Craft|
|---|---|
|1|Ten minutes|
|2|One hour|
|3|Four hours|
|4|Nine hours|
|5|One day|
|6|Two days|
|7|One week|
|8|Three weeks|
|9|Two months|
|10|Six months|

- **5. Complete Subtasks.** The crafting character must complete multiple subtasks that are steps toward finishing the process. The number of subtasks required is equal to the assessed difficulty of the crafting task attempted. So a crafting task assessed as difficulty 5 requires five subtask successes.
    
    The difficulty of each individual subtask begins at 1 and increases by one step for each remaining subtask, until the crafter succeeds on the final, highest-difficulty subtask. Generally, subtask attempts occur at equally divided intervals over the course of the full time required to craft the item.
    
    If at any point the crafter fails on a subtask, the item isn't ruined. Instead, the character only wasted the time spent on that subtask, and can spend that much time again and then try to succeed at that same subtask. If the crafter fails twice in a row on the same subtask, the character can continue crafting, but in addition to losing another interval of crafting time, more crafting material (equal to one of the kind of item needed to craft it) is destroyed in a mishap and must be replaced before crafting can continue.
    
    A player may ask to apply Effort to each subtask. Applying Effort is something they do in the moment, not over the course of days or weeks. Generally speaking, Effort cannot be applied to any crafting task or subtask that exceeds one day.
    

### CRAFTING ARTIFACTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 52)

Crafting an artifact is similar to choosing a new type or focus abilityâ€”the character has many to choose from, they select the one that best fits their intention, and thereafter they can use the artifact much like they'd use any of their other character abilities. The main difference is that most artifacts don't cost Pool points to activate, and character abilities don't have a depletion stat that eventually removes the item from play. Crafting artifacts is handled as a long-term benefit of character advancement; the character and GM agree on the artifact to be crafted, and the character spends 3 XP. If the item is fairly simple, the GM can skip the crafting details and just say that after a period of time, the PC creates the artifact. For an item that significantly alters gameplayâ€”granting the character vast telepathic powers or giving them the ability to teleport at willâ€”the GM can give the item an assessed difficulty equal to 3 + the artifact level and require the character to follow the crafting steps for creating a magical cypher. Crafting this kind of artifact takes up to five times as many materials and up to twenty times as long as crafting a cypher of the same assessed difficulty.

### TIME

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 56)

Ritual magic has two aspects related to time: how long it takes to prepare the ritual, and how long it takes to perform it. The preparation time is how long it takes to get ready to perform the ritual. The performance time is how long the ritual takes from start to finish, once the preparations (if any) are complete.

### DIFFICULTY AND SUBTASKS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 56)

Completing a ritual has an overall difficulty level, usually equal to the level of the challenge. Sometimes there isn't a clear idea of what level the challenge should beâ€” teleporting a group of people to a nearby city and raising a person from the dead don't have an obvious task level. In these cases, the GM should choose a level for the ritual based on what would make an interesting experience for the players. Instead of having the success or failure of this sort of magic come down to one roll, ritual magic lets the GM build tension by requiring the players to make rolls for multiple subtasks. The subtasks start at difficulty 1, and the subtask difficulty increases by 1 each time until the players make a final roll at the highest difficulty. A ritual with an overall difficulty of 4 has four subtasks, with the first one at difficulty 1, the second at difficulty 2, the third at 3, and the last one at 4.

If at any point the PC fails a subtask, the ritual isn't automatically ruined, but it costs timeâ€”a failure means the time spent on that subtask was wasted, but the character can spend that much time again and try to succeed at that same subtask. The GM may decide that later attempts at that subtask are hindered, or that a certain number of failures during the ritual (perhaps equal to half the ritual's overall level) means the whole thing needs to be started again. Skills, assets, and other special abilities can ease subtasks just like they do with any other task (which might make some of the subtasks routine and not require a roll at all). Characters may apply Effort to each subtask.

**Editor's Note â€”** The Perilous Venture horror module makes an excellent supplement to ritual magic.

### POOL INVESTMENT

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 59)

Some rituals might require the PCs to spend points from their Pools on each subtask, with Might representing blood or vitality, Speed representing energy, and Intellect representing will or sanity. Multiple PCs involved in the ritual could collectively contribute to this cost (and if a ritual costs many points, spreading out the cost in this way may be necessary to prevent a participating PC from dying during the ritual).

### ACCELERATED PERFORMANCE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 59)

The GM may allow a character to speed up a ritual, reducing the time required for one or more subtasks. Generally, reducing a subtask's time by half should hinder the subtask, and reducing it by half again (reducing the time needed to a quarter of the normal amount) should hinder the subtask by an additional step (two steps total). The minimum amount of time for a subtask is 1 round (unless the subtask is routine, in which case the GM may allow it to take no time at all).

### EXAMPLE RITUALS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 60)

The following are examples of common magical rituals suitable for many fantasy settings. Specific details of a ritual may vary depending on what the characters are trying to accomplish; for example, a ritual to ask a demon for a favor might be similar to one used to ask an angel, but the exact details are probably very different. Everything listed in a ritual is merely a suggestion, and the GM should alter, add, or remove whatever they like to suit their campaign.

#### UNDERSTANDING THE EXAMPLES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 60)

Each ritual is described in the following format.

Level

 

The overall level of the ritual, which determines how many subtasks it has.

Time

 

The preparation time (if any) and performance time.

Roles

 

Things other characters can do to participate and help.

Side Effects

 

Negative consequences for failed rolls or GM intrusions.

Reagents

 

Resources that can help success.

Pool

 

What kind of Pool points the ritual costs.

Other Assets

 

Kinds of abilities that can help success.

#### BESEECH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 60)

Call upon a powerful supernatural entity such as a deity, archangel, demon lord, or ancient elemental to ask for a favor that the entity can and is likely to do (nothing it would ethically oppose). If the ritual is successful, the entity makes its attention known, such as by manifesting as a light, noise, or visible spirit. It may ask for more information, for a task or favor in return, or for a service to be named later. The entity is not compelled to do the favor; the ritual merely gains its attention and gives the characters the opportunity to speak their case.

- **Level:** The level of the entity
    
- **Time:** Four hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents
    
- **Side Effects:** Curse, hallucination, prerequisite quest (a challenge or task the characters must perform before the entity will consider answering)
    
- **Reagents:** Scroll giving the history of and important details about the entity, offerings of gratitude or appeasement
    
- **Pool:** Might or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Knowledge or control of similar entities
    

Beseech only draws the entity's attention; the various Conjure rituals bring the summoned entity bodily to the ritual space to talk in person.

#### CONJURE THE DEAD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 61)

Summons the spirit of a dead person or creature (commonly called a "ghost"), which appears in the summoning circle prepared for the ritual. The spirit remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners can interrogate them or persuade them to share information. The spirit usually wants something in return (such as messages conveyed to the living or unfulfilled tasks completed). If the characters don't comply, they must magically threaten or compel the spirit to obey.

- **Level:** The level of the dead spirit
    
- **Time:** Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, holding hands in a circle, manipulating a spirit device
    
- **Side Effects:** Haunting, possession
    
- **Reagents:** Mementos of the spirit's life, the spirit's former physical remains, a person or creature to possess
    
- **Pool:** Might or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Knowledge or control of similar entities, religious or cultural connections, secret name of the spirit
    

A ghost remembers much of its life, including whether it knows, likes, or hates the people summoning it, and will act accordingly.

#### CONJURE DEMON

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 61)

Summons a demon (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension, plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The demon is primitive and bestial, not a creature of great wits and charm. The demon remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners must bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer than an hour and requires it to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)â€”spying, murder, and destruction of property are common tasks. Usually the demon has to be threatened or magically coerced into obeying. If the summoners fail to get it to comply, it makes one attack against them and then returns to wherever it came from (and probably bears a grudge for the unwanted summoning).

- **Level:** The level of the demon
    
- **Time:** Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle
    
- **Side Effects:** Aggression, bad smell, curse, equipment damage or theft, possession
    
- **Reagents:** Blood; meat; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle; contracts; a person to possess; objects representing anger, destruction, or hatred (according to the desired service)
    
- **Pool:** Might or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of the demon
    

#### CONJURE DEVIL

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 61)

Summons a devil (an evil supernatural creature from another dimension, plane, or realm) to command or convince it to perform a task. The devil remains there for about a minute, during which time the summoners must bargain with or command it to perform a deed that takes no longer than an hour and requires the devil to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)â€”spying, stealing, guarding, and murdering are common tasks. The devil usually wants something in return (even if just an agreement for a later favor); otherwise, the characters must threaten it or have some way to force it to obey. If the characters fail to strike a bargain, the devil returns to wherever it came from (and probably is annoyed at the interruption).

- **Level:** The level of the devil
    
- **Time:** Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Bloodletting, chanting, lighting candles, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle
    
- **Side Effects:** Bad smell, curse, infernal mark, possession
    
- **Reagents:** Blood; magical inks or paints for a summoning circle; contracts; a person to possess; objects representing betrayal, deception, or greed (according to the desired service)
    
- **Pool:** Might or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Knowledge or control of similar entities, secret name of the devil
    

#### CONJURE ELEMENTAL

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 62)

Summons a primordial elemental spirit of air, earth, fire, or water, which appears in a physical form. The elemental remains for about a minute, during which time the characters must attempt to bribe, threaten, or bargain with it. An elemental is usually summoned to do something that takes no longer than an hour and requires it to travel no more than about 50 miles (80 km)â€”attack, guard, and scout are common tasks. The elemental typically wants something in return for its service, usually a gift or bribe appropriate to its natureâ€”incense for air, gems for earth, oil for fire, salts for water, and so on. If the summoners can't come to an agreement with the elemental, it might make one attack before it leaves.

- **Level:** The level of the elemental
    
- **Time:** Three hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, music, using ceremonial objects, holding gifts/reagents, tracing the summoning circle
    
- **Side Effects:** Damage, weakness toward one kind of attack
    
- **Reagents:** Gifts (black powder, gems, ice, incense, oil, salt, soil, water, wood), destroying opposing items or creatures
    
- **Pool:** Might, Speed, or Intellect, depending on the kind of elemental
    
- **Other Assets:** Elemental power, knowledge or control of similar entities, nature magic, secret name of the elemental
    

Elementals are simple creatures whose interests and attentions are focused on themselves and their element. Flattery and playing up their strengths are the key to bargaining with them.

#### CONSECRATION

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 62)

Wards a location against evil influences and unwanted magic for a year and a day. The ritual affects an area up to a very long distance across. Evil creatures and magical effects of less than the ritual's level can't enter the area or use abilities against it. If the PCs are warded out of the designated area, they must make an Intellect defense roll to enter it (and another each minute while within the area, or retreat) and all their actions inside or targeted within the area are hindered by two steps.

- **Level:** The level of the effects to protect against
    
- **Time:** One hour of preparation, two hours of performance
    
- **Roles:** Drawing lines and symbols along the border, chanting, calling out local features (with candles, runestones, or other suitable markers)
    
- **Side Effects:** Lights, sounds, weak spots or "back doors" in the barrier
    
- **Reagents:** Silver dust, sacred oil, buried blessed gemstones
    
- **Pool:** Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Warding magic, religious knowledge
    

#### ENCHANT WEAPON

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 62)

Enchants a light, medium, or heavy weapon with magical power, granting an asset on attack rolls with the weapon for the next day.

- **Level:** 3 or 4
    
- **Time:** Thirty minutes of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** â€”
    
- **Side Effects:** Weapon attack hindered, higher GM intrusion rate
    
- **Reagents:** Rare oils, gem dust
    
- **Pool:** Speed or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Battle tactics, weapon crafting
    

In a high-magic campaign, a higher-level version of the Enchant Weapon ritual might grant a second asset on attack rolls, grant extra damage, affect multiple weapons at once, or all of the above.

#### ENTOMBMENT

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 63)

Imprisons a creature in a vessel (usually a valuable box, clay pot, or other closeable container, but it might be a gem, the heart of a tree, or another atypical object) for as long as the vessel remains closed and undamaged. The ritual forces the creature into the vessel, either in a spiritual form or by shrinking it to a size that will fit within the vessel.

- **Level:** The level of the creature
    
- **Time:** Sixteen hours of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, carrying or protecting the vessel
    
- **Side Effects:** Bystander imprisoned with the target, containment has a flaw, target lashes out
    
- **Reagents:** Vessel, symbolic bindings (chains, ropes, shackles, and so on), anathema objects
    
- **Pool:** Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Control magic, grappling, imprisoning magic, wards
    

#### EXORCISM

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 63)

Drives out unwanted spirits (ghosts, demons, or something else) from an area up to a long distance across. Once cast out, the spirits cannot return for a year and a day (although most of them decide to move on long before that time comes). Completing the ritual doesn't prevent other spirits from entering or inhabiting the area, but it is likely that they can sense that an exorcism happened there, and most choose to avoid such an area so they don't suffer the same fate. The ritual can also be used to cast out spirits from a possessed creature, preventing those spirits from returning for a year and a day. As with using the ritual to cleanse a location, this doesn't prevent other spirits from afflicting the creature, but later spirits can sense the recent exorcism and prefer to avoid that creature.

- **Level:** The level of the most powerful hostile presence to be exorcised
    
- **Time:** Two hours of preparation, two hours of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, positive emotions, presenting holy objects, restraining afflicted individuals, tracing the area with incense
    
- **Side Effects:** Lights, sounds, hideous physical transformations, injuries, telekinesis
    
- **Reagents:** Bindings, candles, holy water, religious icons and books, scapegoats
    
- **Pool:** Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Warding magic, religious knowledge
    

Using an exorcism ritual on an area is mainly for getting rid of spirits afflicting the area in ways other than possessing a creatureâ€” throwing objects, causing nightmares, making noises, and so on.

#### FLESH FOR KNOWLEDGE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 63)

Sacrifices some of the ritualist's flesh, inflicting Might and Speed damage equal to the level of the ritual and permanently reducing the character's Pools by 4 points (the character can divide this loss between Might and Speed as they see fit). The character experiences painful hallucinations that give them insight and understanding. They immediately learn one type or focus ability available to them (any ability they could learn by spending 4 XP as an advancement).

- **Level:** Twice the tier of the ability the character wishes to learn
    
- **Time:** One hour of preparation, one hour of performance
    
- **Roles:** Chanting, restraining the subject of the ritual
    
- **Side Effects:** Lasting damage, permanent damage, scarring
    
- **Reagents:** Silver knife, silver vessel
    
- **Pool:** See above
    
- **Other Assets:** Pain tolerance, surgery
    

Instead of permanently reducing a character's Pools by 4 points, the GM could allow other permanent penalties such as reducing an Edge stat by 1 (to a minimum of 0), gaining an inability in a useful skill, or permanently reducing all points gained through recovery rolls by 2.

#### PURIFICATION

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 63)

Rids a creature of an ongoing affliction, such as a disease or poison, or any unwanted magical effect, such as a curse or charm spell. In some versions of this ritual, whatever is ailing the creature gets forced into a nearby specified creature or object, which is then discarded or safely destroyed.

- **Level:** The level of the affliction or effect to remove
    
- **Time:** One hour of preparation, two hours of performance
    
- **Roles:** Applying reagents, chanting
    
- **Side Effects:** Affliction or effect spreads to another creature, target moves a step down the damage track
    
- **Reagents:** Anointing oils, healing herbs, objects repellent to the source of the affliction, magical paint for writing on the target, scapegoat, silver dust
    
- **Pool:** Might
    
- **Other Assets:** Healing magic, resistance to the target's affliction
    

#### RESURRECTION

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 64)

Restores a dead being to life. The creature is restored to full health and is ready to act as soon as the ritual is completed. Depending on how they died and the nature of death in the setting, the creature may or may not remember anything that happened after they died.

- **Level:** The level of the deceased (at least tier 6 if a PC)
    
- **Time:** Five hours of preparation, two hours of performance
    
- **Roles:** Applying reagents, chanting, prayers, shielding the corpse from hostile entities
    
- **Side Effects:** Creature moves a step down the damage track, enmity of a death god, lasting damage, scarring, sympathetic damage
    
- **Reagents:** Deceased's corpse, healing ointment, items of emotional significance (such as devotion, hope, or regret), items of importance to the deceased, parchment extolling the deceased's history and deeds, soul-sympathetic items
    
- **Pool:** Might or Intellect
    
- **Other Assets:** Close relationship with the deceased (such as a connection or family relation), healing magic, necromancy, spirit knowledge, secret name of the deceased
    

A lesser version of the Resurrection ritual might bring the creature back to life, but only to the debilitated or impaired state on the damage track instead of hale, requiring further rest or healing.

#### SACRIFICIAL RITE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 65)

A creature is ritually killed and its soul is placed in an object. The soul object might be a temporary destination so the soul can be transported and used elsewhere (such as an offering to a demon or as part of a spell), or it might be the final destination for the soul (such as placing it in a sword to create a magic item).

- **Level:** The level of the creature (at least tier 6 if a PC)
    
- **Time:** One hour of preparation, one hour of performance Roles: Chanting, playing instruments, bearing the soul object, restraining the creature, slaying the creature

- â€  â€” Only against piercing and slashing attacks.

If the GM prefers the simpler method of not tracking whether an attack is bashing, slashing, or stabbing, heavy cloth and padded armor should provide no Armor at all.

Medieval Fantasy Medium Armor

**Editor's Notes â€”** Full Plate and Scale armors have been amended by the editor to correct suspected misprints in their listed Speed Effort cost.

#### ARMOR DESCRIPTIONS

You can wear only one kind of armor at a time (wearing more than one only gives the Armor from the best one and the Speed Effort cost of the worst one).

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 38)

Beastskin

 

An improved form of hides and furs, usually crafted from a creature with especially tough skin such as a giant lizard or rhinoceros.

Breastplate

 

A fitted metal plate or set of plates that protect your torso but not your arms or legs, giving you greater movement than full plate at the cost of some protection.

Brigandine

 

Long strips of metal attached to a cloth or leather backing. Often called "splint mail."

Chainmail

 

Mail armor made from hundreds of interlocking metal rings or links. Often called "chain" or "chain armor."

Dwarven breastplate

 

A high-quality breastplate crafted by a skilled dwarf, providing good protection and great mobility. Dwarven breastplate is medium armor (2 Armor) but encumbers the wearer as if it were light armor (it has a Speed Effort cost of 1). Not all dwarf-crafted breastplates count as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled dwarven smiths know how to make it).

Elven chainmail

 

A high-quality suit of chainmail crafted by a skilled elf, providing good protection and excellent mobility. Elven chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor) but is no more encumbering than a typical outfit of normal clothing (it has no Speed Effort cost). Not all elf-crafted chainmail counts as this type of armor (only exceptionally skilled elven smiths know how to make it).

Full plate

 

A complete suit of fitted metal plates that give excellent coverage and protection against attacks. The joints are protected by small layered plates over flexible chain. Sometimes called "plate mail."

Heavy cloth

 

Clothing that's heavy enough to reduce the effect of attacks against you, such as winter clothing or a fashionable leather outfit. Heavy cloth provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Heavy cloth doesn't have a Speed Effort cost. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

Hides and furs

 

Made from thick or poorly cured animal skins. It's heavier and bulkier than other kinds of leather armor, but easier to make, especially by resource-poor crafters.

Leather jerkin

 

Armor made of hardened pieces of leather (usually boiled or treated with chemicals) that mainly covers your torso. It's stiffer than leather used for clothing, but still flexible enough that you can bend and twist in it. Some jerkins are reinforced with metal studs (and may be called "studded leather"), and brigandine improves upon that concept.

Padded

 

Cloth armor that is deliberately designed with multiple layers to be thick and protective. This is sometimes called "quilted armor" because it is a layer of padding sewn between two layers of cloth. Padded armor provides 1 Armor against piercing or slashing attacks like arrows and swords, but not bashing attacks like clubs or hammers. Padded armor doesn't have a Speed Effort cost. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

Scale

 

Mail armor made from overlapping scales or plates attached to a leather or cloth backing. Often called "scale mail."

Shield

 

Provides an asset to Speed defense rolls. Shield sizes vary from a small buckler to a large kite shield (in the Cypher System, the difference is mainly flavor, and for game purposes they all grant the wearer the same benefit). You must have one free hand to use a shield.

#### ADVENTURING EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTIONS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 41)

Acid

 

A flask of strong acid. Can be thrown up to short range, inflicting acid damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured carefully, it can damage or destroy a small item or areas made of stone or metal.

Adventuring pack

 

Includes 50 feet (15 m) of rope, three days' iron rations, three spikes, small hammer, a set of warm clothes, boots, and three torches.

Alchemist fire

 

A flask of chemicals that burst into flames upon contact with air. The flames burn out after one round. Can be thrown up to short range, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor).

Alchemist tools

 

A sturdy wooden case with tiny flasks, stirring rods, droppers, and other materials used in alchemy. It grants an asset for identifying potion cyphers and similar mysterious liquids.

Bag of heavy tools

 

Contains a hammer, six spikes, crowbar, large tongs, chisel, and 10 feet (3 m) of strong rope.

Bag of light tools

 

Contains a small hammer, small tongs, pliers, small pry bar, awl, lockpicks, 10 feet (3 m) of string, 3 feet (1 m) of metal wire, and a handful of nails.

Battering ram

 

This sturdy plank is capped with hard metal. It provides an asset for breaking down doors.

Book

 

A book with information on a particular topic, such as geography, history, magic, or religion. Provides an asset on appropriate rolls if the character reads or skims the book for at least ten minutes before attempting the task (this assumes the character has already read the book and is looking for relevant information).

Caltrops, bag

 

A bag of hard things you scatter on the ground to slow or injure anyone walking through an area. One bag covers an immediate area and makes that area count as difficult terrain. A creature can safely move through it as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 2 Speed defense roll or take 2 points of Speed damage (ignores Armor).

Candle

 

A candle burns for one hour and creates dim light in an immediate area.

Climbing kit

 

A set of crampons, pitons, ropes, and tools. Provides an asset on climbing tasks.

Crowbar

 

This bent length of metal grants an asset on tasks to open doors, treasure chests, and similar objects.

Disguise kit

 

Makeup, simple prosthetics, and a wig or two, suitable for disguises for a theatrical production. Provides an asset on disguise tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after about five uses.

Healing kit

 

A collection of bandages, needles, thread, and basic medicines. Provides an asset on healing tasks. Some parts are reusable, but the kit runs out after about five uses.

Lamp

 

A hollow container filled with oil that slowly burns to provide light (often resembling a "genie lamp"). A lamp creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it might spill oil, break, or both.

Lantern

 

An improved version of a lamp, with a wick that draws oil and glass or metal panes to protect it from wind. A lantern creates normal light in an immediate area and dim light out to the short area beyond that. It burns for three to four hours on 1 pint (.5 L) of oil. If dropped, it is less likely to spill than a lamp.

Lockpicks

 

Also known as thieves' tools, this set provides everything a skilled person needs to pick locks and disarm traps.

Manacles

 

Metal or heavy wooden restraints that hold an enemy's wrists or ankles in place and are secured with a pin. A common set of manacles is level 5.

Oil

 

A pint (.5 L) of lamp oil in a leather flask. It burns for three to four hours in a lantern or lamp. If prepped with a burning wick, it can be thrown, inflicting fire damage as a light weapon (ignores Armor). If poured on a flat surface, it makes an immediate area slippery. A creature can safely move through the oil slick as if it were difficult terrain (half speed). If a creature moves through the area at normal speed, they must make a difficulty 3 Speed defense roll or slip on the oil and fall prone. Lighting the oil slick makes it burn for one or two rounds and inflicts 1 point of fire damage (ignores Armor) on anyone in or moving through the area.

Signal horn

 

This horn can be heard up to a mile away.

Spyglass

 

This device grants an asset on perception tasks to see things at long range or longer.

Tent

 

This has enough room for two humans or three smaller people.

Torch

 

A wooden stick with some kind of fuel on one end (such as burlap and wax). It burns for one hour, creating normal light in an immediate area and dim light in the short area beyond that. A torch is fragile and usually breaks if used to hit something

### CLOTHING

Ascetic's outfit

 

A simple outfit worn by monks and other people who eschew displays of wealth and status.

Priestly vestments

 

Garments appropriate for performing ceremonies for a specific religion. A common example is a hat or headdress, long tunic or dress, tabard or stole, and shoes, with the outer pieces marked with appropriate symbols.

Traveler's outfit

## FANTASY RULES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 72)

### QUICK REFERENCE: FANTASY RULES

- Awarding Treasure (GF, 72)
- Magical Technology (GF, 65)
- Secret and True Names (GF, 70)
- Wishes (GF, 71)
- Horror Rules (281)(SA, 84)
- Fairy Tale Rules (WAAMH, 48)

### AWARDING TREASURE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 72)

It's best to think of gold and magic as two different kinds of currencies that characters have access to.

#### GOLD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 72)

The Cypher System abstracts item costs into general categoriesâ€” inexpensive, moderate, expensive, and so on. Starting characters generally have access to only a few inexpensive and moderate items and perhaps one or two expensive items. In a typical fantasy campaign, the characters should become wealthier as they advance.

#### MANIFEST CYPHERS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 73)

The expectation is that PCs will use cyphers often because they'll have many opportunities to get more; if the players can exploit this mechanic by selling off most of their cyphers in town, they're abusing the rules to make gold. The GM might be tempted to discourage this behavior by reducing how often the PCs gain new cyphers, but that goes against the premise of cyphers in the game: they should be common enough that the PCs use them freely instead of hoarding them. The key to addressing this selling-cyphers wealth problem is to make it harder to sell or trade cyphers for gold.

The PCs can have opportunities to trade their cyphers with NPCs in town, whether that's at a magic item shop, the tower of a mentor wizard, a thieves' guild, a temple, other adventurers, or the local government. The kinds of cyphers these NPCs can offer may be limited in theme (such as a benevolent church that makes healing potions and trades them for other useful cyphers) or quantity (such as having only one or two cyphers available each month). Two cyphers of the same level are generally considered to be about the same value, although local biases and NPC interests may affect their willingness to trade certain items despite or because of a level disparity.

#### ARTIFACTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 74)

Artifacts are the high end of magical currency, and in terms of buying and selling them, they're like manifest cyphers: not something a typical NPC can use, and beyond what a typical NPC can afford, but they could be traded for a different artifact of about the same level. Unlike cyphers, the game doesn't assume that PCs have frequent opportunities to gain new artifacts or replace the ones that deplete.

In a pinch, an artifact is worth the equivalent of one or two very expensive items or one exorbitant item, depending on what the artifact can do. An artifact that grants an asset to one kind of roll is probably worth about as much as a very expensive item, one that adds +1 Armor might be worth two expensive items, and a strong defensive or offensive artifact could be worth about the same as an exorbitant item.

### MAGICAL TECHNOLOGY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 65)

To craft items of magical technology in a setting where they are commonplace, use the standard rules for crafting regular (nonmagical) items.

#### MAGIC PLUS TECHNOLOGY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 65)

Whatever technology exists in the setting could be magically enhanced if magic is also present. Such items would almost certainly be manifest cyphers or artifacts. Here's an example cypher:

#### FROZEN TIMEPIECE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 66)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** Creates or transforms into a pocket watch that seems to be made of ice. Upon activation of the cypher, the user can take normal actions, but everything and everyone around them is frozen in time. The user cannot affect anything else, but they can move through the world and take actions that affect themselves or their own belongings (bandage a wound, repair a broken item, and so on). The effect lasts for one round per cypher level.
    

And here's an example artifact:

#### TRUTH BINOCULARS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 66)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Pair of binoculars with a large runic symbol on them
    
- **Effect:** Not only do these make it easy to see things far away, but looking through them also allows the viewer to see through illusions and see things that are normally invisible, assuming the effect has a level lower than that of the binoculars.
    
- **Depletion:** 1â€“2 in 1d100 (check each use)
    

To craft items that are both technological and magical, either you need to make the device first and then enchant it, or you need to enchant it as it is made. Either way, the skills for making the device and for making it magical are likely very different.

#### TECHNOLOGY THAT INTERACTS WITH MAGIC

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 66)

In a world with scientists and engineers faced with the presence of real magic, some of them would develop ways to interact and cope with it. Technological devices that are not magical but deal with magic could include:

- **Magic detector (expensive):** This simple white badge glows purple in the presence of magic. Once it detects something magical, it does not function again.
    
- **Mystical hazard suit (very expensive):** This full-body protective suit is cumbersome and clumsy, not unlike a hazmat suit. However, all of the wearer's tasks to resist magical effects are eased. If the wearer takes even 1 point of physical damage, the suit rips and no longer functions until it is repaired and resealed.
    
- **Spellscrambler (very expensive):** Essentially a sonic grenade, this device produces a variety of strange electromagnetic signalsâ€”some audible and very loud, some notâ€”on a number of frequencies. The mental processes needed to cast a spell are impossible to achieve for one round within a short distance of the device. Like any grenade, it can be used only once.
    

#### MAGIC THAT INTERACTS WITH TECHNOLOGY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 66)

In a world where magic and technology coexist, wizards will have spells and effects that protect them from shotgun blasts as well as sword blades, and radiation as well as fire or frost. Consider, for example, these effects as cyphers:

#### FINDING PRYING EYES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 67)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** Magically discovers if anything is watching or listening to the user right at that moment, and reveals the source. Electronic surveillance devices, long-range scopes, hidden cameras, and magical scrying attempts all trigger this effect. In all these cases, the "source" is the nearest representation. So a hidden microphone is revealed, but not the location of the listener.
    

#### POWER DEVICE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 67)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full. If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged.
    

#### SCREEN CONTROL

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 67)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.
    

Because magic works on intuitive rather than scientific levels, mages could have spells that disrupt technology, even though the technology involved might not have any common principles.

### SECRET AND TRUE NAMES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 70)

Learning a creature's true name comes with a subtle and instinctive awareness and understanding of that creature, including its strengths and weaknesses. In general, this eases all tasks related to that creature (including attacks, defenses, and interactions) by two steps. In some cases, confronting a creature with knowledge of its true name might be enough to convince it to perform a service without compensation. A creature doesn't automatically know if someone has learned its true name (although there is magic that can reveal this knowledge), but they can usually figure out that an informed opponent has some kind of advantage against them and deduce that their secret name is involved.

Learning a true name is difficult and takes time. A character wanting to discover a creature's true name might choose the Uncover a Secret character arc to do so.

### WISHES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 71)

Unless the GM's intention is to make the players regret that their characters were offered a wish, it's best to give them what they ask for, as much as it is within the power of the creature to do so. If the GM wants to twist the wish, do so as a GM intrusionâ€” that way, the character still gets a reward, and they can either accept the twisted wish (which isn't as good as they had hoped) or pay 1 XP to reject the intrusion (which represents them coming up with airtight wording that can't be twisted).

Second, consider the level of the creature granting the wishâ€”that's basically the level of the wish, as the creature shouldn't be able to grant a boon more powerful than itself. Therefore, it's reasonable that a level 6 creature could create a level 6 effect. The GM could look at the creature's other abilities (or abilities of other creatures of its level), decide if what the PC is asking for is within its power, and either grant the requested wish or adjust the result downward until it's appropriate for the creature's power.

Wishing for more wishes doesn't work because a creature shouldn't be able to create something more powerful than itselfâ€”at least not without some investment of time and other resources, like a character using XP to acquire an artifact.

## DUNGEONS, CASTLES, AND KEEPS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 75)

This section describes several kinds of common physical features and their game stats. Any of these levels can be adjusted up or down by the GMâ€”a wall made from soft wood can have a lower level than a typical wall, stone can be reinforced by magic so its level is higher, and so on.

### WALLS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 75)

Walls are generally either constructed (intentionally built by a creature) or natural (already existing without any work by a creature). Anything describing walls in this section also applies to ceilings and floors.

- **Paper wall (level 1):** This thin wall only blocks sight. Creatures can attack through a paper wall as if attacking blindly (hindered by four steps), but it's usually easier to break a hole in the wall and attack through the hole. Paper walls are vulnerable to piercing and slashing weapons (attacks are eased). A gauzy curtain is equivalent to a paper wall, and a cloth wall is probably level 2.
    
- **Wooden wall (level 4):** This is a typical wall for an average wooden house. The walls of a decrepit shack or a partition within a dungeon might be only level 2 or 3, but the exterior palisade wall of a fort or a log cabin might be level 5. Wooden walls are vulnerable to fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing weapons (attacks are hindered).
    
- **Stone wall (level 6):** Constructed stone walls are bricks or masonry (fitted stones), with or without mortar to hold them in place, or hewn stone (dug into existing natural rock). Natural stone walls are usually unworked stone (like a cave wall or cliff face, which tend to be uneven) but might have areas where creatures smoothed or modified them to suit their needs for a living space. Some constructed stone walls are reinforced with metal bars on the surface or built inside, increasing its level to 7. Stone walls are vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered).
    
- **Iron wall (level 7):** These expensive walls are usually reserved for protecting something important, like a vault.
    

### DOORS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 76)

Doors are access points for encounters and (if trapped or infested with dangerous creatures) can be encounters all on their own. In most cases, trying to break through a door involves damaging its latch or hinges rather than destroying the main portion of the door (trying to destroy the door instead of the latch and hinges is a hindered task).

- **Simple wooden door (level 2):** This is a fragile door meant to close off an interior space for privacy rather than to keep out a determined intruder. Instead of a single piece of wood, a simple wooden door is usually made of multiple planks nailed together on a frame or with support struts. Wooden doors of all strengths are vulnerable to fire (attacks with fire are eased) but resistant to bashing and piercing weapons (attacks are hindered).
    
- **Good wooden door (level 3):** This is a stronger door meant to provide some security, such as for a typical house or shop.
    
- **Strong wooden door (level 4):** This is a heavy door reinforced with wood or metal to make it difficult to break. An especially strong wooden door, such as the main entrance to a fort or castle, is probably level 5.
    
- **Stone door (level 5):** These heavy doors are usually carved from a solid block of stone and designed to pivot on a center point. They are common in places like dungeons where wood and metal are scarce. Stone doors are vulnerable to piercing weapons (attacks are eased) but resistant to bashing and slashing weapons (attacks are hindered).
    
- **Iron door (level 6):** A solid iron door is meant to protect something very valuable or vulnerable, such as a vault or a king's tomb. In a damp environment like a dungeon, they tend to rust and stick in place.
    
- **Wooden portcullis (level 3):** The gaps in a portcullis present more defense opportunities than a door, such as allowing archers to fire at the creatures trapped by it. They're also useful in closing access to a waterway without impacting its flow. A wooden portcullis is relatively fragile and usually isn't meant to keep anyone out for long.
    
- **Iron portcullis (level 6):** Much sturdier than wood, an iron portcullis is meant to keep creatures in place as long as necessary. Often the best way to get past a portcullis is to lift it instead of breaking it, but some are designed to lock in place to prevent this. A door to a prison cell is essentially a type of iron portcullis.

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 76)

One common element of fantasy explorationâ€”particularly for castles and dungeonsâ€”is the danger of traps.

#### TRIGGERING TRAPS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 76)

Mechanical traps have a triggering mechanismâ€”something set up to react when an unauthorized creature is in the area. Magical traps have triggers that are usually based on proximityâ€”if a creature enters the area the trap is "watching," it activates.

#### FINDING TRAPS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 77)

Most characters won't notice traps unless actively looking for them; they don't know a trap is in the area until their presence, movement, or action triggers it. Characters can passively or actively search for traps if they suspect such dangers are present.

Passive searching for traps means one character (usually in the front of the group) is carefully checking the area before moving forward. This means the group moves at about half normal speed, but they get to make a search roll for any traps the GM has in their path. Allowing characters to passively search in this way means the players don't have to keep stating over and over that they're looking for traps. The drawback for them is that it takes them more time to get anywhere (which means time-based special abilities and cyphers will run out sooner).

Active searching is used when the characters worry or suspect that there is a trap in the area and want to find it. Active searching takes about one round for each immediate area searched. Rather than having the players make separate rolls for each immediate area, the GM should have them make one roll for the entire room; if successful, they find the trap, and if they fail, they don't find it. If there is a second trap, the GM can have them make another roll after they've resolved the first trap.

#### DISABLING, DAMAGING, AND BYPASSING TRAPS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 78)

A character can attempt to disable a trap so it's no longer able to activate or harm anyone. Normally this task has the same difficulty as the trap's level, but some traps are rickety and easy to disable, while others are carefully crafted and much harder to disable. Traps are objects and use the object damage track. Characters can attack a trap with weapons or special abilities to damage or destroy it. Some traps may be vulnerable to certain attacks or unusual means of sabotage (such as hammering a piton into a groove where a blade springs out). Magical traps can be damaged or disabled with special abilities.

Instead of disabling a trap, a character can try to bypass it so they and their allies can get past it without triggering it but still leave it as a danger to anyone else who passes through the area. The task to bypass a trap is hindered by two steps.

Failing an attempt to disable, bypass, or sabotage a trap means it activates. Usually the trap's target is the acting character, and the trap's attack is eased because the character placed themselves in harm's way.

Unless a character has the ability to manipulate magic, it's very difficult to bypass a magical trap (the attempt is hindered by two additional steps).

#### UNDERSTANDING THE LISTINGS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 79)

The rest of the chapter presents a large number of traps with game stats. Every trap is presented by name, followed by a standard template that includes the following categories. If an entry doesn't apply to a particular trap, it is omitted from the listing.

Level

 

Like the difficulty of a task, each trap has a level. You use the level to determine the target number a PC must reach to find, evade, or disable the trap. In each entry, the difficulty number for the trap is listed after its level (always three times the trap's level).

Description

 

This general description explains what the trap does, how it operates, whether it resets automatically, if it has a limited number of uses, and so on.

Damage Inflicted

 

Generally, when a trap hits a creature, it inflicts its level in damage regardless of the form of attack (arrow, poison, collapsing ceiling, and so on). The entries always specify the amount of damage inflicted, even if it's the normal amount for a trap of its level.

Modifications

 

Use these numbers when a trap's information says to use a different target number. For example, a level 4 trap might say "defends as level 5," which means PCs attacking it or trying to disable it must roll a target number of 15 (for difficulty 5) instead of 12 (for difficulty 4). Typical modifiers are to the trap's attacks, defenses, and stealth (how hard or easy it is to notice the trap).

GM Intrusion

 

This entry suggests one or more ways to use GM intrusions in an encounter with the trap. It's just one possible idea of many, and the GM is encouraged to come up with their own uses of the game mechanic.

#### COMMON TRAP POISONS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 80)

Blindness

 

The poison blinds the creature if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour.

Choking

 

The poison makes the creature choke and cough if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are one minute, ten minutes, and one hour. Severe versions of choking poison might make a creature start to suffocate.

Damage Track

 

The poison moves the creature down one step on the damage track if they fail a defense roll.

Debilitating

 

The poison hinders all of the creature's actions by one or two steps if they fail a defense roll. (Some poisons may affect only certain kinds of actions, such as Speed defense rolls or Might-based tasks.) Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours.

Instant Damage

 

The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect) one time if the creature fails a defense roll.

Ongoing Damage

 

The poison inflicts damage (Might, Speed, or Intellect) immediately. When a certain amount of time has passed (such as every round or every minute), it inflicts damage again if the creature fails its defense roll. The ongoing damage usually ends on its own (such as after five additional rounds of damage) or after the creature makes a defense roll against it. Usually the ongoing damage is a much smaller amount than the initial damage, such as 1 point every round.

Paralysis

 

The poison prevents the creature from taking any physical actions if they fail a defense roll (this might leave them standing in place like a statue, or make them go limp and collapse to the floor). Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours.

Sleep

 

The poison knocks the creature unconscious if they fail a defense roll. Typical durations are ten minutes, one hour, and ten hours. The poison might also make the creature groggy, hindering all actions for an additional amount of time equal to how long the unconsciousness would have lasted (for example, knocking out a creature for an hour and then making them groggy for an hour, even if they're awakened early).

#### ARROW4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 81)

Fires an arrow or crossbow bolt. The simplest one-use trap of this kind is an actual crossbow (perhaps hidden behind a hole in a wall or door) rigged with a tripwire to pull the trigger; a creature would need to manually reset this trap for it to be a danger again. More complex traps might automatically reload from a supply of bolts so the trap can be triggered multiple times, or fire automatically once triggered until the ammunition is expended. A variant of this trap releases a volley of arrows into the targeted area, affecting multiple creatures or the same creature more than once.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points
    
- **Modifications:** Defense and stealth as level 6 (if hidden behind a hole in the wall)
    

**GM Intrusion:** The arrow is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of damage. The arrow is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other end tied to something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical shock.

#### CRUSHING WALL6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 81)

A section of a wall falls over onto the targeted character. This is usually a one-use trap (although a similar trap could be built in its place).

A variant of this trap is a deadfall, where something heavy (such as a log, huge stone block, or cart full of rocks) falls from a higher position onto the character. Sometimes the falling block is made to exactly fit a trapped corridor so that triggering the trap makes the area impassible.

A less lethal variant drops a large amount of sand or dirt, inflicting 3 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). Another variant releases oil (perhaps burning) or marbles, inflicting 3 points of ambient damage and making the area difficult terrain.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points (ignores Armor)
    

**GM Intrusion:** The fallen wall blocks access to an exit. The wall debris buries the character, who is trapped until they can dig free. Another trap, hazard, or threat is behind the fallen wall (such as arrow traps or a room full of zombies) and can now reach the characters.

#### DISINTEGRATION7 (21)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 81)

A magical ray of eerie energy blasts the character, disrupting their physical matter. Any creature killed by the ray (or any object destroyed by it) turns to dust.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 15 points
    

**GM Intrusion:** In addition to inflicting damage, the ray moves the character one step down the damage track. Part of the ray splits or ricochets off the character and strikes a second creature, inflicting 10 points of damage.

#### EXPLOSIVE GLYPH4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 81)

A magical rune activates when touched or passed over, exploding in an immediate or short area. Typical glyphs inflict acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, but more unusual versions include ones that inflict holy, shadow, thorn, unholy, or stranger types of magical energy damage. A nonmagical variant of this trap sprays a mist of acid, a jet of electrified salt water, or a gout of burning oil.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 4 points of energy damage (ignores Armor); all creatures in the area take 1 point of damage even if they make their defense roll.
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth as level 5
    

**GM Intrusion:** The glyph marks the character's face with a symbol indicating they are a thief. The glyph makes the character run away in fear for one minute. The character is cursed, and all of their actions are hindered until the curse is removed.

#### FLOODING ROOM4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 82)

Exits to the room close off and the area starts to fill with water. Within a few minutes, the entire room is flooded and creatures in it begin to drown.

A variant of this room reduces the air pressure (either by pumping it out through tiny holes or by retracting the floor or ceiling). As the air gets thinner, characters are hindered by one, two, or three steps before falling unconscious and starting to suffocate. (Restoring the air allows the characters to awaken, but doesn't move them back up the damage track.)

- **Damage Inflicted:** None until drowning starts
    
- **Modifications:** Defends as level 7
    

**GM Intrusion:** Hostile creatures such as piranhas or electric eels are in the water and attack all creatures. The room fills with water faster than expected because the floor and/or ceiling are also moving toward each other.

#### MANGLER3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 82)

A small hole in the wall extends sharp blades or weights when a creature reaches into it, mangling their hand and hindering all actions requiring that hand by one or two steps.

A floor variant is a small trapdoor over a closed compartment, which mangles the character's foot when they step on the trapdoor, reducing their movement speed by half.

Another variant is a needle trap attached to a small peephole or spyhole in a door or wall. The trap springs when the character touches the area around the hole (even a slight touch with their face as they look is sufficient), inflicting lasting damage to the character's eye and partially blinding them. A gentler variant traps the character's limb in glue instead of inflicting damage. The character's extremity might be glued to the hole, or they may be able to pull free but have a glue pot stuck on their hand or foot.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 3 points, plus lasting damage
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth as level 4
    

**GM Intrusion:** The trap has hooks, holding the character in place and inflicting damage when they try to escape if they fail a Speed defense roll. The glue attracts a swarm of fire ants or wasps. The glue is also a slow-acting acid or poison.

#### NET3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 82)

A net suspended above the character drops and constricts (and perhaps lifts the character off the ground). Large net traps can affect multiple creatures at once. This kind of trap usually requires a creature to manually reset it.

A variant of this trap is a snare made of sturdy cord or wire.

- **Damage Inflicted:** Entanglement (trapped character cannot move until they use an action to make a Might or Speed defense roll to break or escape the net)
    
- **Modifications:** Attacks as level 5, defends as level 2
    

**GM Intrusion:** The net is barbed, inflicting 1 point of damage each round that the trapped character tries to move. The net is the nesting place for biting insects, which swarm and attack the trapped character and all nearby creatures each round.

#### PIT4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 82)

A trapdoor in the floor opens, dropping the triggering character into a pit. Larger versions of this trap can catch multiple characters at once. The trap can be reset by moving the trapdoor back into its closed position. In outdoor areas, this trap is more likely to be a pit covered in leafy branches (or a tarp) and camouflaged by soil and other debris.

A variant of this trap is a bridge over a chasm, river, or other dangerous location that is rigged to collapse when enough weight reaches the middle section.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet fallen (ignores Armor)
    

**GM Intrusion:** The trapdoor is slippery with oil, hindering attempts to catch the edge and avoid falling. The trapdoor closes after the character falls through, trapping them inside in the darkness. The walls of the pit are greased, hindering attempts to climb out by two steps. A dangerous creature is at the bottom of the pit (or in a room adjacent to it). The pit is filled with poison gas. The trapdoor detaches and falls into the pit, inflicting 1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet it falls. The pit has spikes at the bottom, inflicting an additional 4 points of damage to anyone who falls in.

#### POISON GAS3 (9)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 83)

The area slowly fills with poison gas. Because it takes a minute or more for the poison to become thick enough to cause harm, it is likely that the character won't realize at first that they've sprung a trap.

A variant of this trap fills the room with flammable gas, which explodes if there is an open flame (such as from a torch) or a spark (such as a metal weapon against metal armor), inflicting fire damage equal to the trap's level.

A further variant fills the room with dead air (containing no oxygen), which slowly extinguishes flames and suffocates creatures.

- **Damage Inflicted:** As poison
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth as level 5
    

**GM Intrusion:** The character has an allergic reaction to the gas, which hinders all their actions for an hour after exposure because of sneezing, watery eyes, or itchy skin. The gas makes the character hallucinate, mistaking their companions for enemies, until they make an Intellect defense roll. The gas is flammable.

#### POISON NEEDLE5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 83)

A poisoned needle jabs at a character touching the trapped object (usually a lock or treasure chest) or is fired from a mechanism similar to an arrow trap. It may have a reservoir of poison that allows it to attack several times.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 1 point (plus poison)
    
- **Modifications:** Stealth as level 6
    

**GM Intrusion:** The trap releases acid into the lock mechanism, making the trapped object impossible to unlock. The trap releases acid into the container, destroying some of the valuables inside. The trap releases a puff of poison gas instead of a poisoned needle, affecting all nearby characters.

#### PORTCULLIS5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 84)

An iron portcullis drops from the ceiling to block access to an area or separate a character from others nearby. If the creature dodging the falling portcullis wants to choose which side of the trap they end up on, the Speed defense roll is hindered. Otherwise, it is even chances what side they end up on.

A variant of this trap is a solid wall. A magical variant is a force field.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    

**GM Intrusion:** The portcullis impales the character, trapping them beneath it until it is lifted or destroyed. The portcullis is electrified, inflicting 1 point of damage each time it is touched or attacked with flesh or a metal object. A second portcullis drops nearby, trapping a character in a small area. Murder-holes in the ceiling allow enemies to make ranged attacks on the trapped character.

#### ROLLING BOULDER6 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 84)

A large boulder, wheel, or barrel rolls into the area, crushing anything in its path. Depending on the configuration of the area, the boulder might follow a specific path, ricochet erratically, break open pit traps, or get stuck somewhere.

A variant is a large iron weight on a chain that swings from the ceiling. The weight swings back and forth several times, giving it multiple chances to hit the characters, but decreasing its damage with each swing until it stops and becomes an obstacle.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Modifications:** Defends as level 7
    

**GM Intrusion:** The boulder crashes through a door or wall, giving other dangerous creatures access to the character's location. The boulder blocks the way out. The boulder carries a character along with it for some distance. The boulder is hollow and full of burning oil, leaving a fiery trail behind it. The boulder is hollow and contains undead skeletons, which jump out as it moves and attack nearby creatures.

#### SLICING BLADE5 (15)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 85)

A thin blade slices out from a gap in the wall, floor, or ceiling. The trap might be designed to sweep the entire area (such as the width of a corridor) or leave a tiny safe space just beyond the blade's reach so a creature who knows of the trap can get past it. This kind of trap is usually designed to reset automatically after a minute or has a lever nearby that allows a creature to reset it manually.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 5 points
    
- **Modifications:** Attacks as level 6
    

**GM Intrusion:** The blade is a magical weapon with an additional effect, such as inflicting 3 points of fire damage. The blade is rusted and breaks off when it hits the character, inflicting 1 point of damage (ignores Armor) each round after the initial attack until it is healed.

#### SLIDING STAIR4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 85)

A stairway or section of stairs unexpectedly turns into a ramp. Anyone who makes a Speed defense roll can catch hold near where they were standing; otherwise, they slide or tumble to the bottom and take damage. This kind of trap usually resets after a minute or has a manual reset lever at the top or bottom of the stairs.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 1 point of ambient damage per 20 feet slid (ignores Armor)
    

**GM Intrusion:** The trap releases oil, hindering attempts to climb the ramp or stairs by two steps. Tiny blades stick out between the sections of the ramp, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage. The trap releases a boulder to roll down the stairs after the sliding character, inflicting an additional 3 points of damage.

#### SNAKE PIT4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 85)

The trap drops the character into a pit full of snakes or drops a large number of snakes on the character. The snakes immediately attack the character and perhaps others in the area.

- **Damage Inflicted:** As per the swarm of snakes
    

**GM Intrusion:** The snake poison is especially potent, moving the character one step down the damage track if they fail a Might defense roll. The snakes constrict the character, hindering their actions until the snakes are defeated.

#### SPEAR4 (12)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 85)

The trap fires a spear, javelin, or other large projectile.

In many ways, this is a scaled-up and more dangerous version of an arrow trap, and the same suggestions for that trap apply to this one.

- **Damage Inflicted:** 6 points
    
- **Modifications:** Defense and stealth as level 5 (if hidden behind a hole in a wall)
    

**GM Intrusion:** The impact of the spear knocks the character prone. The spear is barbed, and removing it inflicts 3 points of damage. The spear is attached to a string, cord, or wire, with the other end tied to something dangerous like a falling block or an electrical shock

#### TELEPORTER6 (18)

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 85)

The trap magically moves the character to another location within about 1,000 feet (300 m), typically a prison cell, an oubliette, or a very deep pit. It's more efficient to kill an intruder than to teleport them, so teleportation is usually reserved for trapping creatures for interrogation.

- **Damage Inflicted:** None
    

**GM Intrusion:** The teleport destination is above the ground, causing the character to fall some distance and take damage (1 point of ambient damage per 10 feet fallen). The destination is dangerous, such as a tiny room lined with spikes, a shark tank, or a boulder in a lava lake.

## FANTASY CYPHERS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 138)

Magic items are a staple of fantasy stories and games. In the Cypher System, these magic items are, of course, cyphers. The Cypher System assumes that subtle cyphers are the default, but in a fantasy game the assumption is usually the oppositeâ€”cyphers are physical objects (manifest cyphers) with magical powers, which the heroes find as treasure, gifts, or rewards for their adventures and exploits.

### MIXING SUBTLE AND MANIFEST CYPHERS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 138)

There's no reason why a fantasy campaign can't use manifest cyphers and subtle cyphers. In this setup, manifest cyphers are the tangible objects found in treasure hoards, and subtle cyphers represent good fortune, the blessings of the gods, and other coincidences that benefit the characters.

### FANTASY CYPHER FORMS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 138)

What form a manifest cypher takesâ€” such as a potion or scrollâ€”doesn't affect its abilities at all. A potion that eases the user's next task by three steps is functionally identical to a magical scroll that does the same thing.

To randomly determine a manifest cypher's form, roll on the following table.

Cypher Form

|d100|Cypher Form|
|---|---|
|01â€“02|Bone runeplate|
|03â€“04|Book page|

|19â€“20|Carved tooth|
|21â€“23|Chalky potion|
|30â€“33|Clay runeplate|
|34â€“37|Crystal|
|38â€“39|Elaborate scar|
|40â€“42|Envelope of powder|
|43â€“44|Fuming potion|
|45â€“47|Glass|
|48â€“50|Leaf|
|51â€“54|Leather scroll|
|55â€“57|Metal runeplate|

## A SELECTION OF FANTASY CYPHERS

### ACID RESISTANCE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 141)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** The user gains Armor against acid damage equal to the cypher's level for one hour.
    

### ANIMAL CONTROL  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 141)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** To activate the cypher, the user must succeed on an Intellect attack against a beast whose level does not exceed the cypher's level. If successful, the beast immediately becomes calm. The beast awaits the user's commands and carries out all orders to the best of its ability. The target remains so enslaved for a number of hours equal to the cypher's level minus the target's level. (If the result is 0, the target is enslaved for only one minute.) The beast could attack or defend, a dog could follow a scent or retrieve an object, a badger could dig a hole, and so on.
    
    The cypher doesn't give the user any special ability to understand the target or perceive through its senses. For example, the user can command an eagle to fly above a group of enemies, but the eagle can't describe what it sees and the user can't look through its eyes.
    
    "Beast" in this sense refers to creatures of animal-level intelligence and may include unintelligent magical creatures like basilisks, pegasi, and so on.
    

### BEAST SHAPE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 141)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** The user transforms into a specific kind of animal, such as a bear, hawk, horse, or wolf (the kind of animal is determined by the cypher's creator). The user gains the animal's type of movement (swimming for a fish, flying for a bird, and so on) and two assets on tasks to pretend to be that animal. The user also gains an asset on one skill appropriate to their animal form (or two skills for cypher level 5 and higher). See the Animal Form Minor Abilities table.
    
    The magic shrinks or enlarges the user to a size more suitable for their animal form, but generally can't make them more than about 50 percent smaller or larger, so the user might become an unusually large bird or a small bear. This doesn't affect the animal's abilities. The user can still use all of their abilities that don't rely specifically on their normal form. For example, an Adept in wolf form can't wield a dagger because wolves don't have hands, but could still use a healing power or mind blast ability.
    
    After about an hour, the user returns to their normal form.
    
    Depending on the cypher, the user might still be able to speak in a humanoid language, talk in a "language" of animal noises that other transformed people can understand perfectly, speak with animals of the same kind, or none of the above.
    

### COLD RESISTANCE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** The user gains Armor against cold damage equal to the cypher's level for one hour.
    

### DEMON WARD  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher's level against damage from demons, devils, and similar malevolent creatures.
    

In a typical fantasy campaign, a demon is a supernatural being from another dimension or plane of existence.

### DRAGON WARD  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher's level against damage from dragons, wyverns, and similar magical reptilian creatures.
    

### ELECTRICITY RESISTANCE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** The user gains Armor against electricity damage equal to the cypher's level for one hour.
    

### ELEMENTAL CONJURATION  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** Summons an elemental creature (air, earth, fire, or water) that can understand the verbal commands of the user. Once the elemental is summoned, commanding it is not an action. It can make attacks or perform actions as ordered to the best of its abilities, but it cannot speak. The elemental never goes farther than long range away from the user.
    
    The elemental is not particularly intelligent or capable of initiating action. It responds if attacked, but otherwise does only as commanded.
    
    The elemental remains for one hour per cypher level or until its physical form is destroyed, after which it vanishes back to its native realm.
    

### FIRE RESISTANCE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 142)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** The user gains Armor against fire damage equal to the cypher's level for one hour.
    

### GIANT SIZE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** The user grows to about one and a half times their normal size. While at this larger size, they add 4 points to their Might Pool and +2 to their Might Edge, but their Speed defense rolls are hindered.
    
    They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Might Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Speed defense, and they subtract 4 points from their Might Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Speed Pool and then, if necessary, from their Intellect Pool).
    
    If the user is an NPC, the cypher increases their health by 4, eases their Might-based tasks, and hinders their Speed defense. When the effect ends, they lose 4 health and all of the other advantages and penalties from the cypher.
    

### INSTANT BOAT  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** Creates or transforms into a small sailboat that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must row, steer, and sail the boat as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the boat grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the boat can move a short distance each round under its own power. The boat lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.
    

### INSTANT TOWER  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** Creates a simple, squat stone tower with a door, three arrow slits, and a ceiling hatch leading to the roof. The tower is 10 feet (3 m) square and 12 feet (4 m) tall. If the cypher level is 7 or higher, the tower also has a second story (with four arrow slits), increasing its total height to 20 feet (6 m). If there isn't sufficient room for the tower to reach its full size, it fills the available space, but its appearance and growth does not apply any force or pressure against the confining surfaces.
    
    The tower is permanent and immobile once created.
    

### LYCANTHROPE WARD  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher's level against damage from werewolves and other lycanthropes.
    

Lycanthrope

 

Formally, a human who can transform into a wolf. Informally, a human who can transform into an animal, such as a bear, rat, tiger, or wolf

### PENULTIMATE KEY  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Effect:** Locks or unlocks any one door, portal, chest, or other lockable item of the cypher's level or lower. The targeted item must have a keyhole for the cypher to work.
    

Legends speak of the Ultimate Key, which can open any lock, even those sealed by a god.

### POISON RESISTANCE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 143)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Effect:** The user gains Armor against poison damage equal to the cypher's level for one hour.
    

### RESTORATIVE AURA  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 144)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** Creates an immediate area filled with aromatic smoke, reassuring sounds, gentle light, or other pleasing sensations that last for one hour. Creatures who rest within the area gain +2 on their recovery rolls (or +4 for cypher level 5 and higher). NPCs instead recover 2 health if they spend at least ten minutes within the area (or 4 health for cypher level 5 and higher). For a creature to gain this benefit, its entire rest must occur while the cypher is active.
    

### THOUGHT LISTENING  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 144)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Effect:** The user can read the surface thoughts of a creature within short range that they can see, even if the target doesn't want them to. Once the user has established contact, they can read the target's thoughts for up to one minute per cypher level.
    

### TINY SIZE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 144)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** The user shrinks to about one-tenth their normal size. While at this smaller size, they add 4 points to their Speed Pool and +2 to their Speed Edge, but all of their Might actions are hindered by two steps. They return to their normal size after a minute. When the effect ends, their Speed Edge returns to normal, they lose the penalty to Might actions, and they subtract 4 points from their Speed Pool (if this brings the Pool to 0, they subtract the overflow first from their Intellect Pool and then, if necessary, from their Might Pool).
    
    If the user is an NPC, the cypher eases their Speed-based tasks and hinders their Might-based tasks. When the effect ends, they lose all of the advantages and penalties from the cypher.
    

### UNDEAD WARD  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 144)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** For one hour, the user gains Armor equal to the cypher's level against damage from skeletons, zombies, ghosts, vampires, and other undead creatures.
    

### WALKING CORPSE  

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 144)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Effect:** Animates a corpse as a level 1 (or level 2 for cypher level 5 and higher) undead skeleton or zombie, depending on the condition of the body. The corpse can be no larger than a typical human. The animated corpse has none of the intelligence, memories, or special abilities that it had in life. The creature follows the user's verbal commands for one hour, after which it becomes an inert corpse. Unless the creature is killed by damage, the user can reanimate it again when its time expires, but any damage it had when it became inert applies to its newly reanimated state.

## FANTASY ARTIFACTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 145)

In many ways, fantasy is the genre for artifacts. All magic itemsâ€”wands that shoot lightning, magic carpets, singing swords, rings that make the wearer invisible, and so onâ€”are artifacts. Below are a few sample artifacts to give a template for GMs to follow. Those running a fantasy campaign will likely want to create many magic artifacts.

If cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy, artifacts are the more durable magic items that can be used over and over againâ€”swords, armor, tomes of weird magic, cloaks of invisibility, and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many artifacts a character can bear; an entire campaign might stem from an ongoing quest to collect all of the legendary items carried by a famous hero.

### EXAMPLE FANTASY ARTIFACTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 145)

The artifacts are divided into two tablesâ€”one for minor items (artifacts that don't have particularly flashy or world-affecting abilities) and one for major items (artifacts that do). A GM running a campaign where magic is subtle, weak, or otherwise limited can use the minor items table, and a GM of a campaign where some magic can do powerful or even impossible things can roll on either table.

## A SELECTION OF FANTASY ARTIFACTS

### ADAMANTINE ROPE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 147)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** A 50-foot (15 m) length of black rope
    
- **Effect:** This length of rope has the flexibility of ordinary rope but a hardness greater than steel. It is impervious to damage (including attempts to cut it) from anything less than the artifact's level.
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### ALCHEMIST BAG

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 145)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Embroidered velvet bag
    
- **Effect:** This bag can contain up to one cypher per artifact level, as long as each is no larger than a typical potion bottle or scroll case. These cyphers do not count against a character's cypher limit.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each time a cypher is added to the bag)
    

### ANGELIC WARD

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 257)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Tiny figurine of a winged angel
    
- **Effect:** Once activated, the figurine's spirit emerges and becomes semisolid as a glowing, human-sized winged angel. It follows within 3 feet (1 m) of the figurine owner. Anything within long range that attacks the owner is attacked by the angelic ward, which sends out a bolt of flesh-rotting energy, doing damage equal to the artifact's level. Once activated, it functions for a day.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### ARMORED CLOTH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 147)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Suit of typical clothing (robe, dress, jerkin and breeches, and so on)
    
- **Effect:** This clothing is soft and flexible, as expected, except when it is struck or crushed with force, at which point it hardens, providing +1 to Armor. It then immediately returns to its normal state (which is in no way encumbering). This clothing cannot be worn with armor of any kind.
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### BELT OF STRENGTH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 147)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Thick leather belt with a metal buckle and rivets
    
- **Effect:** The belt enhances the strength and endurance of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Might Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the belt, any excess Might points above their normal maximum Might Pool are lost; if they wear the belt again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### BOOK OF ALL SPELLS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 147)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Weighty tome filled with pages of spell runes
    
- **Effect:** This mysterious spellbook is said to contain knowledge of hundreds of spellsâ€”perhaps even all spells. Each set of facing pages includes the magical runes for one spell and a description of the spell and how to use it.
    
    When a character first opens the book, the GM randomly determines what type of spell is shown by rolling on the following table, then rolling on the indicated table in the _Cypher System Rulebook_:
    

Book of All Spells

|d6|Cypher Type|
|---|---|
|1â€“2|Roll on the Manifest Cypher Table|
|3â€“5|Roll on the Fantastic Cypher Table|
|6|Roll on the Subtle Cypher Table|

- The bearer can cast the spell on the page as if it were a cypher with a level equal to the book's level. This doesn't remove the spell from the page (it can be cast again and again), but it does require a depletion roll.
    
    As part of another action, the bearer can turn the page to find a new spell, but only forward, never backward. It is said that turning to the last page makes the book vanish and appear somewhere else in the world.
    
    The artifact always remembers the last page it was turned to. Opening the book always presents that page. Attempting to copy, remove, or destroy a page only makes the book turn to a later page on its own.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100 (Check each time the book is used or the bearer turns a page. The chance of depletion increases by 1 each time it is used [1 in 1d100, 2 in 1d100, 3 in 1d100, and so on]. Instead of depleting, the book might turn to a later page, or disappear and reappear somewhere else in the world.)
    

### BOUNDING BOOTS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Sturdy but flexible boots
    
- **Effect:** The boots assist the wearer's every step to make jumping and running easier. The boots are an asset for jumping and running (easing one of these skills by two steps if the artifact is level 6 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### CAT'S EYE SPECTACLES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Pair of dark crystalline spectacles in a dull wooden frame
    
- **Effect:** Outside, the wearer can see at night as if it were daylight. Inside, the wearer can see in pitch darkness up to short range (or to long range if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### CLOAK OF BALAKAR

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Blue cloak with elaborate designs suggesting blowing wind
    
- **Effect:** The wearer can calm winds of the artifact's level or lower in a radius of 1 mile (1.5 km). Up to once a day, the wearer can create a destructive windstorm up to that size, lasting one minute; this storm's level is equal to half the artifact's level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (on depletion, cloak disappears and reappears somewhere else in the world)
    

### CLOAK OF ELFKIND

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Thin greyish-green cloak with a cowl and clasp
    
- **Effect:** When activated (by drawing the hood over the wearer's head), the cloak takes on the colors and textures of everything around the wearer for ten minutes (or one hour if the artifact is level 8 or higher). This eases hiding and sneaking tasks by two steps. While the cloak is activated, the wearer can also see in the dark.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### CLOAK OF FINERY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Multilayered cloak of glittering material
    
- **Effect:** This cloak is woven of beautiful fibers and set with dazzling gems. It automatically fits itself to its wearer in the most flattering way. When activated, it enhances the wearer's appearance, voice, tone, and even their grammar, granting an asset to all interaction tasks for the next minute.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### COIL OF ENDLESS ROPE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Coil of rope
    
- **Effect:** The coil of rope can be let out at a rate of 50 feet (15 m) per round; however, no end to the rope can be found no matter how long the user uncoils it. The rope retains its incredible length until recoiled or until it becomes depleted. If cut, any length beyond the coil's initial 50 feet crumbles into powder after a round or two.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each use that extends it beyond 50 feet)
    

### CROWN OF EYES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 148)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Metallic circlet set with several crystal spheres
    
- **Effect:** It takes one round to activate the crown. When activated, the crystal spheres separate from the crown and fly around the wearer at immediate range for an hour. The wearer can see anything the crystal spheres can see. This allows the wearer to peek around corners without being exposed to danger. This gives the wearer an asset in initiative and all perception tasks.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### CROWN OF THE MIND

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 149)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Crown, circlet, headband, diadem, or amulet
    
- **Effect:** The crown augments the mind and thoughts of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Intellect Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the crown, any excess Intellect points above their normal maximum Intellect Pool are lost; if they wear the crown again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects). (GF, 149)
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### CRYSTAL BALL

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 149)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Melon-sized crystalline or glass orb, with or without a support stand
    
- **Effect:** This allows the user to scry (view) remote locations and creatures. The user must make a difficulty 2 Intellect task to activate the crystal ball, then use an action trying to make it show a person or location they know. The user must succeed at an Intellect task against the level of the target; otherwise, the crystal shows only indistinct or misleading images. The task roll is modified by how familiar the target is to the user, how available they are to be viewed, and how far away they are.
    

Crystal Ball: Familiarity

|Familiarity|Difficulty|
|---|---|
|Only have name or description|Hindered|
|Target has been visited|Eased|
|Target is well known to the user|Eased|

Crystal Ball: Availability

|Availability|Difficulty|
|---|---|
|Target is willing|Eased|
|Target is unwilling|Hindered|

Crystal Ball: Distance

|Distance|Difficulty|
|---|---|
|More than 1 mile|Hindered|
|More than 10 miles|Hindered|
|More than 100 miles|Hindered|

- These modifiers are cumulative, so trying to view a level 4 target who the user knows only by name (+1 step), is unwilling (+1 step), and is 20 miles away (+2 steps) is a difficulty 8 task.
    
    The crystal shows the creature or area for one minute before the image becomes muddled and the artifact must be activated again.
    
    In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to apply a level of Effort to open two-way communication with the viewed area. All creatures in the area can sense the user's presence and hear their voice, and the creatures can speak to and be heard by the user.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

An unwilling creature's defenses against magic and Intellect attacks should hinder scrying attempts just as they would against a directly harmful mental spell.

### DEATH'S SCYTHE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 149)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Double-handed scythe
    
- **Effect:** This scythe functions as a heavy weapon. In addition, it instantly kills level 1 or level 2 creatures it hits. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, the user can choose to use a level of Effort to affect a higher-level target; each level of Effort applied increases the level of creature that can be instantly killed by the scythe. Thus, to instantly kill a level 5 target (three levels above the normal limit), the wielder must apply three levels of Effort.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check per killing effect; upon depletion, a manifestation of Death appears to reclaim its blade)
    

Death manifestation

 

level 7

**Editor's Notes â€”** The _deflecting shield_ (GF, 150) is not presented in the CSRD.

### DEMONFLESH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 150)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Ball of black leather with vein-like red streaks
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the ball liquefies and coats the body of the user for one hour, appearing to be a form-fitting leather suit veined with pathways of dully glowing blood. As an action, the wearer can become invisible. While invisible, they are specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. This effect ends if they do something to reveal their presence or positionâ€”attacking, casting a spell, using an ability, moving a large object, and so on. If this occurs, they can regain the remaining invisibility effect by taking an action to focus on hiding their position. The wearer can inflict 3 points of damage with a touch by releasing a dark crackle of demonic power. This attack ignores most Armor, but Armor made to ward against evil or demonic attacks should work against it. (GF, 150)
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### DEMONIC RUNE BLADE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 150)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Sword inscribed with demonic runes
    
- **Effect:** This longsword functions as a medium weapon, but it is actually a powerful demon transformed into the shape of a sword. The demon cannot speak directly to the wielder, but it can make its desires known by emitting bass rumbles and dirgelike melodies, and by pulling in the direction of its desire. The sword eases all attacks made with it by one step, and it inflicts 4 additional points of damage (for a total of 8 points).
    
    If the wielder kills a creature with the sword, the sword eats the creature's spirit and transfers some of its energy to the wielder, adding 5 points to their Might Pool and increasing their Might Edge by 1. This lasts for an hour and allows the wielder to exceed their normal Might Pool and Might Edge stats.
    
    If the wielder misses with an attack, the blade sometimes hits an ally of the wielder instead (this always happens on an attack roll of 1).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (check each time a killed creature's life force is absorbed; if depleted, the sword's magical abilities can be recharged if it kills an "innocent" creature)
    

### DRAGONTONGUE WEAPON

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 150)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Weapon that roars with red flame when activated, trailing a stream of black smoke
    
- **Effect:** This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its type. If the wielder uses it to attack a foe, upon a successful hit, the wielder decides whether to activate the flame. Upon activation, the weapon lashes the target with fire, inflicting additional points of damage equal to the artifact level. The effect lasts for one minute after each activation.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### DRAGONTOOTH SOLDIERS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Burlap bag containing a handful of large reptilian teeth
    
- **Effect:** If a tooth is drawn from the bag and cast upon the earth, a dragontooth warrior appears, ready to fight for the user for up to ten minutes before going their own way. The user can draw several teeth at once from the bag, but each tooth drawn requires a separate depletion roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

Dragontooth warrior

 

level equal to the artifact level, Speed defense as artifact level + 1 due to shield; Armor 1; spear attack (melee or short range) inflicts damage and impedes movement of victim to immediate range for one round

### ELFBLADE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Medium sword
    
- **Effect:** This sword can be used as a normal medium sword that deals 2 additional points of damage (for a total of 6 points). The short sword can cut through any material of its level or lower with ease, owing to its exceptional sharpness. The blade sheds a blue light as bright as a candle to warn when goblins, orcs, trolls, or similar creatures are within 300 feet (90 m).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### ENCHANTED ARMOR

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor
    
- **Effect:** This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor (or +2 if the artifact is level 7 or higher) beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so enchanted chainmail provides a total of 3 Armor (for artifact level 6 or lower) or 4 Armor (for artifact level 7 or higher).
    
    The additional Armor provided by the magic also applies to damage that often isn't reduced by typical armor, such as heat or cold damage (but not Intellect damage).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### EXPLODING ARROW

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Arrow with runes carved on the shaft and head
    
- **Effect:** The arrow explodes when it strikes something, inflicting its level in damage to all within immediate range. Roll d100 to determine the type of damage.
    

Exploding Arrow Damage

|1d100|Exploding Arrow Damage|
|---|---|
|01â€“20|Acid|
|21â€“40|Electricity|
|41â€“60|Cold|
|61â€“90|Fire|
|91â€“00|Necromantic (harms only flesh)|

- **Depletion:** Automatic (GF, 151)
    

One advantage of an exploding arrow over a detonation cypher is that the arrow doesn't count toward your cypher limit.

An exploding arrow can instead be a crossbow bolt, sling stone, or other thrown weapon or projectile.

### EXPLORER'S GLOVES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Thick but flexible-fingered leather gloves
    
- **Effect:** The wearer can cling to or climb any surface for up to one hour. Even level 10 climbing tasks become routine while the gloves are activated, but taking any other action while climbing requires a new activation.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### FALCON CLOAK

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 151)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Cloak made of feathers
    
- **Effect:** For ten hours, the wearer becomes a falcon whose level is equal to the artifact level. The falcon can fly a long distance each round, or up to 60 miles (97 km) per hour when traveling overland.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

Most magic items that turn a character into a different creature make it difficult to use any of the character's special abilities (other than skills) in that form.

### FLYING CARPET

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 152)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Silken rug with repeating designs bordered with a pattern that suggests scudding clouds
    
- **Effect:** The carpet flies a long distance each round, carrying up to five passengers. It flies for up to ten hours per activation. When traveling overland, the artifact can achieve a flying speed of 60 miles (97 km) per hour.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### GHOSTLY ARMOR

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 152)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Full suit of light, medium, or heavy armor
    
- **Effect:** This armor is carefully crafted and reinforced with magic to be stronger and more protective than typical armor. It is armor according to its type (light, medium, or heavy), but it grants an additional +1 Armor beyond what it would normally provide. For example, chainmail is medium armor (2 Armor), so ghostly chainmail provides 3 Armor.
    
    When activated, the armor randomly makes the wearer ghostly and immaterial for ten minutes (or for one hour if the artifact is level 9 or higher), which hinders attacks on the wearer by two steps without hindering any of the character's abilities. Special multidimensional weapons or attacks (such as abilities meant to harm ghosts) ignore this defense.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (for the ghostly defense ability, but after depletion, the suit still functions as normal armor and provides its full Armor value)
    

### GLOVES OF AGILITY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 152)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Supple leather or cloth gloves
    
- **Effect:** The gloves enhance the dexterity and reflexes of the wearer. This increases the wearer's maximum Speed Pool by 5 (or by 7 if the artifact is level 6 or higher). If the wearer removes the gloves, any excess Speed points above their normal maximum Speed Pool are lost; if they wear the gloves again, the points do not automatically return (they must be restored with recovery rolls, healing magic, or similar effects).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### GRUELMAKER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 152)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Clay bowl stamped with symbols of fish and birds
    
- **Effect:** The bowl fills itself to the brim with a bland-tasting tan porridge that provides enough nutrition for one person for one day (or two people if the artifact is level 5 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### GUARDIAN IDOL

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 152)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Demonic idol on top of a thin metal leg that is 1 foot (30 cm) tall
    
- **Effect:** It takes two rounds to balance this artifact on its metal leg, and then it requires an action to activate. When activated, the idol stares at the activating character and nearby creatures for five rounds, memorizing their faces and shapes. After that, if anything the idol doesn't recognize (and is larger than a mouse) comes within long range, it spits a small ball of fire at the target. The fire inflicts damage equal to the artifact level. The idol can attack up to ten times per round, but it never attacks the same target more than once per round. It remains on watch for twenty-four hours or until it has made one hundred attacks, whichever comes first.
    
- **Depletion:** Automatic
    

### HAND OF GLORY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 153)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Dried humanoid hand with candle-tip fingers
    
- **Effect:** A hand of glory has several potential uses, including the following. In all cases, the candles making up the hand must be lit and burning to produce an effect. Insensibility: A target within short range is held motionless and unable to take actions as long as the lit hand remains within range (or until the target is attacked or otherwise snapped out of the trance). Invisibility: User is invisible for up to one minute while holding the hand. While invisible, the user is specialized in stealth and Speed defense tasks. Thief 's Passage: A locked or barred door or a container whose level is less than or equal to the hand's level becomes unlocked when touched by the hand.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### HELM OF WATER BREATHING

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 153)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Green metal helm with a scaly or fishy motif Effect: The wearer's head is enveloped in a tight bubble of air that constantly renews itself, allowing them to breathe underwater indefinitely, speak normally, and so on.
    
- **Depletion** 1â€“2 in 1d100 (check each day)
    

### HORN OF THUNDER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 153)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Large signal horn banded with metal and carved with runes
    
- **Effect:** This massive instrument can barely be held or carried by a single person. When activated, it emits a 50-foot (15 m) wide cone of pure sonic force out to long range. Any creature in that area is knocked prone and stunned for one round, losing its action. Unfixed items the size of a human or smaller are toppled and/or moved at least 5 feet (1.5 m). Larger objects might also be toppled.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### INSTANT LADDER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 153)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Small lightweight metal rod with gem buttons
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the rod extends and produces rungs so that it can be used as a ladder up to 28 feet (9 m) long. The ladder can be transformed back into its rod form from either end.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

A creature unfamiliar with the buttons on an instant ladder needs to spend several rounds figuring out the proper sequence to expand or collapse it.

### LIGHTNING HAMMER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 153)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Massive silver hammer that crackles with electricity
    
- **Effect:** This hammer functions as a normal heavy weapon. However, if the wielder uses an action to activate it, the weapon radiates electricity for one round. If used to attack on the next round, the hammer inflicts an additional 10 points of electricity damage. The user can choose to strike the ground instead, sending shockwaves of electricity outward that deal 5 points of damage to everyone within short range.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (still usable as a normal heavy weapon after depletion)
    

### MASTERCRAFT ARMOR

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Armor of exceptional quality
    
- **Effect:** This armor grants its wearer an asset for Speed defense rolls.
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### MASTERCRAFT WEAPON

- **Form:** Weapon of exceptional quality
    
- **Effect:** This weapon grants its wielder an asset for attack rolls made with it.

Depending on the game world, mastercraft armor and weapons might be magical, mundanely crafted with exceptional quality, or both.

### MINDSHIELD HELMET

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Lightweight cloth, leather, or metal helmet
    
- **Effect:** The wearer gains 3 Armor that protects against Intellect damage only. Further, attempts to affect the wearer's mind are hindered (or hindered by two steps if the artifact is level 7 or higher).
    
- **Depletion:** â€”
    

### NECROMANTIC WAND

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Bone wand carved with runes
    
- **Effect:** This wand emits a faint short-range beam of sickly violet light that affects only organic creatures and materials. Living targets hit by the beam move one step down the damage track. Nonliving organic targets are likely destroyed.
    
    This device is a rapid-fire weapon and thus can be used with the Spray or Arc Spray abilities that some characters have, but each "round of ammo" used or each additional target selected requires an additional depletion roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### PACK OF STORAGE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Leather backpack or haversack with multiple pockets
    
- **Effect:** This pack's mouth can be loosened to open as wide as 6 feet (2 m) in diameter. It is larger on the inside than on the outside, and can carry up to 500 pounds (226 kg) or 10 cubic feet (.3 cubic m). The pack weighs about one-tenth as much as it is holding.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100 (check each time something is added to the pack; on depletion, all objects are expelled from the pack)
    

### POISONER'S TOUCH

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Very thin transparent glove with faint markings
    
- **Effect:** When the wearer activates the glove (which might require speaking a command word or tracing a specific pattern on its surface), it secretes a small amount of poison. The next creature the wearer touches with the glove takes Speed damage equal to the artifact level (ignores Armor) and must make a new Might defense roll each round or suffer the damage again until either they succeed at the defense roll or five rounds pass, whichever comes first.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### PROTECTION AMULET

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 154)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Stylized amulet worn on a chain

### RING OF WISHES

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 155)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Plain gold band
    
- **Effect:** The user makes a wish, and it is granted, within limits. The level of the effect granted is no greater than the level of the artifact, as determined by the GM, who can modify the effect accordingly. (The larger the wish, the more likely the GM will limit its effect.)

### SOUL-STEALING KNIFE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 155)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Night-black blade in which distant stars are sometimes visible
    
- **Effect:** This knife functions as a normal light weapon. However, if the wielder wishes, on a successful attack, it inflicts additional damage (ignores Armor) equal to the artifact's level. If damage from the dagger reduces a target to 0 health, the target's soul is drawn into the blade. The soul remains trapped there for up to three days, after which time it is consumed. (Alternatively, the wielder can release the soul to whatever its fate would otherwise be.)
    
    As a separate activation, the wielder can ask three questions of a creature whose soul is trapped in the blade and not yet consumed. After answering the third question, the soul is consumed.

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 257)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Weapon of any type, with engraved glowing runes denoting soulflaying
    
- **Effect:** This weapon functions as a normal weapon of its kind. The wielder can use an action to activate its soulflaying magic for one minute. During that time, if the weapon scores a hit, it inflicts normal damage, plus 3 additional points of Intellect damage on all creatures that have souls (not automatons, mindless undead, or the like).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### SOVEREIGN KEY

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 156)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Slender golden key
    
- **Effect:** When touched to a lock or the surface of a sealed object (such as a chest, envelope, or urn), the key briefly glows and attempts to open the target. Sealed objects fall open like peeled fruits if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level, and locks open easily if their level is equal to or less than the artifact level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10 (GF, 156)
    

### SPELLBOOK OF ELEMENTAL SUMMONING

The elemental appears and does the summoner's bidding for up to one hour, unless it somehow breaks the geas created by the book. (GF, 156)
    
- **Depletion:** 1â€“3 in 1d20
    

### SPELLBOOK OF THE AMBER MAGE

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 257)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Weighty tome bound in amber filled with pages of spell runes
    
- **Effect:** When the user incants from the spellbook and succeeds at a level 3 Intellect-based task, the user can attempt to trap a creature within long range inside a block of amber. Only creatures whose level is equal to or lower than the artifact's level can be targeted. A creature successfully caught is preserved in perfect stasis until the encasing amber is broken away (the amber has 10 points of health per level of the artifact).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (257)
    

### STAFF OF BLACK IRON

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 156)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Staff of black iron set with an eye-shaped crystal headpiece
    
- **Effect:** The wielder can use an action to gain one of the following effects.
    
    - _Influence:_ The wielder makes a mental attack on a creature within immediate range by providing a suggestion. An affected target follows any suggestion during its next turn that doesn't cause direct harm to itself or its allies.
    - _Lightning:_ The wielder discharges a bolt of lightning that attacks all targets along a straight line out to long range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact level.
    - _Shield:_ For one hour, the wielder gains the protective effect of using a normal shield (an asset on their Speed defense rolls). This effect is invisible and doesn't require them to hold a shield; merely touching the staff is sufficient.
    
    The staff can have more than one effect ongoing at a time (such as using the shield ability and blasting someone with lightning), but each requires a separate activation and depletion roll.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### STAFF OF HEALING

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 156)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Wooden staff capped with a golden icon
    
- **Effect:** The staff emits a short-range beam of silvery light that affects only living creatures. A living creature hit by the beam moves up one step on the damage track. A target that is not down on the damage track can immediately make a free recovery roll (or, for NPCs, regain a number of points of health equal to three times their level).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

### STAFF OF THE PROPHET

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 157)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Short wooden staff
    
- **Effect:** The staff has three abilities, each of which requires an action to activate.
    
    - _Sea Passage._ Creates a dry route through a body of water. The route is approximately 20 feet (6 m) wide, up to 1,000 feet (300 m) deep, and as long as the body of water is wide. The path remains open for up to four hours, or the wielder can collapse it as an action.
    - _Snake Form._ Staff transforms into a venomous snake whose level is equal to the artifact level. The snake has a bite attack that inflicts 6 points of damage, plus 3 additional points of Speed damage (ignores Armor) for three rounds on a failed Might defense roll. The snake obeys the wielder's verbal commands, but it can't do anything a regular snake couldn't do.
    - _Water From Stone._ Produces approximately 10 gallons (38 liters) of pure water within immediate range, as if from a natural spring in the ground.
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### STORM SHACK

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 157)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Miniature model of a simple wooden shack
    
- **Effect:** Activating the artifact transforms it over the next few rounds into a simple wooden shack that is 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) with a thin door. Everything inside the area of the full-size shack is protected from most forms of inclement weather for one hour (or ten hours for artifact level 6 and higher). Leaving or entering the shack before the duration is up makes it harmlessly collapse upon itself unless the character succeeds on a Speed roll against the artifact's level. If collapsed early or the duration runs out, the shack collapses into sticks, dust, and the miniature model, which can be taken and reused.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

### TRAP RUNESTONE

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 157)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Pouch with chalk, sealing wax, and an engraved runestone
    
- **Effect:** A simple cypher (such as a potion or scroll) can be modified with this set of implements to turn it into a trap. First, the cypher is attached to a surface with the sealing wax, then the user must make a difficulty 4 Intellect task to draw the runestone symbols around the edge of the cypher with the chalk and place the runestone in the correct position. When the trap is triggered, the cypher is activated, so people often use straightforward cyphers such as an explosive spell scroll, a poisonous potion, and so on.
    
    The trigger can react to a specified movement within 3 feet (1 m)â€”a door opening, a creature or object moving past the runestone, and so on. The higher the level of the artifact, the more sophisticated the trigger. For example, a level 4 artifact's trigger might be based on a creature's size or weight, a level 5 artifact can trigger based on a specific type of creature, and a level 6 artifact can trigger based on recognizing an individual creature.
    
- **Depletion:** Automatic
    

### TUNNELING GAUNTLETS

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 157)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Oversized pair of metallic gauntlets with broad nails
    
- **Effect:** When activated, for one hour the gauntlets let the wearer burrow up to an immediate distance each round. They can burrow through most soils and even some stone, but only through material whose level is lower than the artifact level. Burrowing leaves behind a tunnel with a diameter of 5 feet (1.5 m) that remains stable for several hours. After that, the tunnel is subject to collapse.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### VORPAL SWORD

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 158)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Long sword that sometimes whispers and snickers aloud
    
- **Effect:** The vorpal sword cuts through any material of a level lower than its own. It is a medium weapon that ignores Armor of a level lower than its own. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, the suggested minor or major effect is decapitation if the artifact is higher level than the foe (use this only if the foe has a head; otherwise, choose a different effect).
    
- **Depletion:** 1â€“2 in 1d100 (check each decapitation and specific attempt to cut through solid material)
    

### WAND OF FIREBOLTS

(CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK, PAGE 257)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Wand of red wood 8 inches (20 cm) long, carved with intricate flamelike images
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the wand looses a blast of fire at a chosen target within short range, inflicting damage equal to the artifact's level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### WAND OF SPIDER'S WEBBING

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 158)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** White oak wand
    
- **Effect:** This wand produces a long-range stream of grey spider's webbing that entangles a target and holds it stuck to nearby surfaces. Entangled victims can't move or take actions that require movement. Targets whose level is higher than the wand's level can usually break free within one or two rounds. The entangling web is highly flammable, and if ignited it burns away over the course of one round, but the intense heat inflicts damage equal to the artifact level on whatever was caught within it.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

### WHISPERER IN THE ETHER

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 158)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Small crystal
    
- **Effect:** The bearer of this crystal can telepathically communicate with an immortal being whose location is unknown (probably another dimension or a godly or infernal realm). The user can converse with the intelligence on an ongoing basis, but in general, the whisperer can share a useful bit of information, insight, or advice about once every day. Sometimes, this translates into an asset on one of the user's actions. For example, the intelligence can suggest the right phrase to make friends with a shopkeeper to get a good deal, the right tools to use while trying to break open a door, or the right place to put a shield to deflect an incoming attack. Sometimes the information is more broad, such as the right road to take to reach the next town or why a group of monsters is attacking the caravan the bearer is guarding.
    
    The whisperer's willingness and ability to converse varies considerably. Sometimes it is quite chatty and offers advice. Other times, it must be convinced, cajoled, or tricked into giving information. And sometimes, it is entirely absent for reasons it will not explain. The whisperer's knowledge base is broad but not omniscient. It cannot see the future, but it can often predict outcomes based on logic.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each day)
    

### WITCH'S BROOM

(GODFORSAKEN, PAGE 158)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** A 6-foot (2 m) long wooden broom
    
- **Effect:** As a vehicle, the broom can be ridden a long distance each round. On extended trips, it can move up to 100 miles (160 km) per hour.
    
    The bearer can call upon the broom to grant them a powerful hallucinogenic state that lasts for four hours, during which time all tasks are hindered. After the hallucinations end, the bearer's Intellect tasks are eased for the next ten minutes.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
