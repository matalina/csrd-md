#### MODERN MAGIC DESCRIPTORS 

##### QUICK REFERENCE: MODERN MAGIC DESCRIPTORS 

-  Chimera (IOM, 37)
-  Dragon (IOM, 38)
-  Ghost (IOM, 39)
-  Hunter (IOM, 40)
-  Nix (IOM, 41)
-  Sylph (IOM, 42)
-  Unmagical (IOM, 43)
- or  Fantasy Species Descriptors

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 36)

Most of these descriptors are for characters who are or become significantly nonhuman; for example, the  Dragon descriptor means you're a four-legged, winged dragon who can breathe flame. These descriptors include suggestions for how to advance or improve your inherent nature as that sort of creature (becoming even more dragonish if you are a Dragon, for example). The GM should allow a character with such a descriptor to choose any of these abilities (and any others the GM feels are appropriate for the descriptor) in place of a  type ability, either upon advancing to a new tier or selecting them as an other option of  character advancement by spending 4  XP.

**Editor's Notes —** The  Species as Descriptor section is worth reading before deciding what will work best for your game.

##### CHIMERA 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 37)

You have a blend of animal attributes; you may be a well-known mythological creature, like a satyr or minotaur, or you may have a unique combination of features. Bison horns, boar tusks, bear paws, a wolf's tail, a lion's mane: take your pick. Your thickened skin offers protection from attacks and the elements. Depending on your dexterity—and whether you have opposable thumbs—you may use adaptive weapons and tools, like a dagger modified to be held in a paw instead of a hand. You're eager to protect the ones closest to you, and usually more likely to run toward conflict than away from it.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Fur and Hide:** +1 to Armor.
    
- **Animal Strength:** +1 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Charging Ahead:** You're trained in initiative.
    
- **For the Gang:** You stick up for your friends. When you  draw the attack, your defense is only hindered by one step.
    
- **Ham-fisted:** Tasks requiring fine motor skills are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. A herd, a pride, a pack, a flock: whatever the collective noun for chimeras is, you're looking to build (or join) one.
2. You need supplies to adapt a legendary weapon perfectly to your physique.
3. The other PCs were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and you protected them from harm.
4. You were held hostage by someone running a chimera fighting ring, and the other PCs freed you.

- **Chimera Advancement:**
    

-  Athlete (111)
-  Dual Light Wield (132)
-  Enhanced Might (135)
-  Enhanced Speed (135)
-  Fists of Fury (140)
-  Frenzy (143)

##### DRAGON 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 38)

You can shift at will between a dragon and humanoid form; you may choose to spend more time in one form or the other. In your dragon form you're about 10 feet (3.5 m) long with four legs, leathery wings, and a serpentlike tail. You're drawn to treasure and shiny things, but you're willing to share your hoard with those you trust. Though you can speak human languages, you can't ignore the fact that you're a wild part of your local ecosystem—at least some of the time. You're an apex predator, driven to fly and to hunt, and you brumate in cold temperatures like other reptiles.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Dragon Form:** You have both a humanoid form and a dragon form, and you can switch forms up to four times in a 24-hour period. In dragon form, your Speed defense tasks are hindered due to your size. Enabler.
    
- **Tough:** +2 to your Might Pool.
    
- **Fireproof:** +2 Armor against damage inflicted by fire or heat.
    
- **Wings (1 Might point):** When you have wings, you can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.
    
- **Teeth:** You are skilled in making unarmed bite attacks, which are a medium weapon in your dragon form and a light weapon in your humanoid form. Enabler.
    
- **Spitting Flames (1+ Might point):** You can breathe a ball of fire at a target within short range, inflicting 3 points of fire damage. In addition to the normal options for using Effort, you can use Effort to affect more targets; each level of Effort affects one additional target. Action.
    
- **Inability:** Cold weather makes you want to burrow somewhere cozy and go dormant. Speed tasks are hindered when the temperature falls below 50° F (10° C).
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The other PCs were hired as dragon hunters, but once they met you they realized their mission was misguided.
2. You're hoping to find a specific discontinued currency to add to your hoard.
3. You got stuck in your dragon form while molting, and the other PCs helped remove your shed skin.
4. You're gathering ingredients for a difficult spell that will increase the range and intensity of your fire-breathing attacks.

- **Dragon Advancement:**
    

-  Danger Sense (124)
-  Defensive Field (127)
-  Enhanced Might (135)
-  Enhanced Might Edge (135)
-  Enlarge (135)
- Training in Spitting Flames

Brumation is a state of sluggishness and inactivity entered by reptiles in response to low temperatures.

##### GHOST 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 39)

Unfortunately, you're dead. But hey, it's not all bad! Your spirit has remained in the mortal world. You can still walk among the living, but you no longer need pesky things like food or sleep. It's up to you how long you've been dead, whether you remember your death, and why you've stuck around: seeking revenge, settling a debt, protecting your descendants, perfecting your great-grandma's pecan pie recipe, or something else entirely.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Ghostly Wisdom:** +2 to your Intellect Pool.
    
- **Sneaky:** You're trained in stealth and intimidation.
    
- **Incorporeal:** You're trained in Speed defense.
    
- **Calling the Dead:** You're trained in communicating with other ghosts, wraiths, undead, and so on. You can also serve as a catalyst for communication with the dead, providing an asset to a living character attempting such a task (such as a séance or summoning).
    
- **Insubstantial:** All physical attacks are hindered.
    
- **Dead:** Positive social interaction tasks with living creatures are hindered.
    
- **Uniform:** You're permanently wearing the clothes you had on when you died. This can hinder social interactions if you're inappropriately dressed for the setting (wearing a bathrobe and slippers to a formal party, for example).
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You're on a journey to make amends with someone you wronged in life.
2. You're looking for the resting place of your physical body so you can be resurrected.
3. One of the other PCs is a distant relative, and you need to keep them alive so your bloodline continues.
4. You're studying the secrets of reincarnation and suspect that one of the other PCs has vital information.

- **Ghost Advancement:**
    

-  Duplicate (132)
-  Question the Spirits (172)
-  See the Unseen (180)
-  Speaker for the Dead (184)
-  Surprise Attack (188)
-  Walk Through Walls (196)

##### HUNTER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 40)

You once rode with the Wild Hunt: an immortal cavalry who traversed the skies in secret each night, gathering the souls of those who died in battle and carrying them to the beyond. These days, the Wild Hunt has downsized and your nights are your own. You're mortal again, too, but it's impossible to forget the terrifying freedom and power you once held. Maybe you've let nostalgia make you bitter, or maybe you don't miss the Hunt at all, instead living in fear of being conscripted once more.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Agile:** +2 to your Speed Pool.
    
- **Equestrian:** You're trained in handling and riding horses.
    
- **Sword Hand:** You're proficient with two-handed swords and can use them without penalty.
    
- **Hearing the Dead:** You're skilled in all social interactions with ghosts.
    
- **The Call of the Hunt:** You're often distracted by sounds that remind you of the Wild Hunt, such as horns and baying hounds. Tasks requiring concentration are hindered.
    
- **Lost Years:** In the years you belonged to the Wild Hunt, you lost touch with advancing technology. Tasks involving computers, pop culture, and recent history are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You ferried the soul of a PC's relative to the afterlife. When you left the Wild Hunt, you found the PC to tell them of their relative's brave deeds.
2. The living only see the Wild Hunt cross the sky if they're destined for disaster. A PC saw the Wild Hunt years ago, and you've taken it upon yourself to protect them.
3. You're afraid that the leader of the Wild Hunt will summon you, and you need help concealing yourself.
4. You're searching for the horse you remember riding—a massive undead stallion with flaming hooves.

##### NIX 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 41)

You're a shapeshifting water spirit. You can walk on two legs and breathe air, but when you're submerged, you gain a tail, fins, and gills. You probably live near flowing water, with no preference for salinity or temperature; you also have a general affinity for nature and a knack for identifying useful plants. Your playful and upbeat disposition doesn't mean you're passive or helpless. Though you may prefer to talk your way out of tough situations, you're quick to react to threats—especially in water, where you maneuver with deadly accuracy.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Transformation:** When submerged in water, you transform into a fish/human hybrid with gills, fins, sharp teeth, and a tail. This transformation is automatic. Enabler.
    
- **Unchillable:** +2 Armor against damage caused by cold or ice.
    
- **Sharp Teeth:** You are skilled in making an unarmed bite attack, which is a medium weapon in your aquatic form and a light weapon in your humanoid form. Enabler.
    
- **Quick Swimming:** You can swim a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action.
    
- **Close to Nature:** You're skilled in identifying plants and animals.
    
- **Siren Song:** You're extremely charismatic. You're skilled in persuasion and deception.
    
- **Distractible:** You have a hard time focusing. You're hindered in tasks involving knowledge or lore, as well as resisting mental attacks.
    
- **Inability:** When you're in water, attacks using weapons are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. The other PCs were stranded in a shipwreck, and you saved them.
2. A factory is polluting your local body of water, and you're looking for revenge.
3. You played a prank on the other PCs while they were swimming; after a good laugh, they invited you to join them.
4. You've been sent to search for a rare plant, believed by many to be extinct.

- **Nix Advancement:**
    

-  Calm Stranger (119)
-  Enhanced Speed (135)
-  Restful Presence (177)
-  Ruin Lore (179)
-  Soothe the Savage (184)
-  Wilderness Life (199)

##### SYLPH 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 42)

You're an air spirit, with the gift of wingless flight and hawklike eyes. You're happiest when you have an aerial view; you lean more toward strategy than action, calling the shots from an unmatched vantage point. Your sensitivity to air currents and atmospheric pressure means you're able to predict weather patterns, which you incorporate into your machinations.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Master Plans:** +2 to your Intellect or Speed Pool.
    
- **Sylph Flight (2 Intellect or Speed points):** You can fly a long distance as your action, or a short distance as part of another action, for up to ten minutes total. Enabler.
    
- **Top-Down Strategy:** You're skilled in logistics and planning.
    
- **Sharp Vision:** You're trained in visual perception.
    
- **Oncoming Storm (1 Intellect point):** You can predict weather patterns (approaching storm systems, cloud cover, wind direction) for the next twelve hours. Action.
    
- **Fragile:** Might defense tasks are hindered.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. You saw the other PCs headed toward danger and called out a warning before the situation turned sour.
2. You got in trouble for flying in restricted airspace, and the other PCs helped cover for you.
3. You need help with a spell that will enable you to communicate with birds of prey.
4. You helped the other PCs recover a kite that became tangled in tree branches and power lines.

- **Sylph Advancement:**
    

-  Enhanced Intellect (135)
-  Enhanced Speed (135)
-  Eyes Adjusted (138)
-  Influence Swarm (153)
-  Precision (171)
-  Shock (183)

##### UNMAGICAL 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 43)

You're not good at using magic. In fact, it's clear that you're inherently unmagical—magic is as confusing, difficult, and awkward for you as learning lava spells would be for a frost giant. It's not that you don't believe in magic (though maybe you don't) or that you don't like magic (though maybe you don't). It's just that you and magic are incompatible. You've learned to compensate for this problem and even turn it into an advantage in some cases.

You gain the following characteristics:

- **Make Do With the Mundane:** +1 to each of your Pools.
    
- **Resistant to Magic:** You are trained in all defense rolls against magic, spells, and magical effects.
    
- **Inability:** All actions using magic (including casting spells and using magic objects) are hindered.
    
- **Magical Failure:** Your unmagical nature means magic goes awry more often. For any task relating to or interacting with magic, you trigger a  GM intrusion on a d20 roll of 1 or 2.
    
- **Initial Link to the Starting Adventure:** From the following list of options, choose how you became involved in the first adventure.
    

1. One of the other PCs initially diagnosed you as unmagical, which made a lot of your life suddenly make sense.
2. You think this group of PCs might be on track to figuring out why some people are unmagical and perhaps "fixing" them.
3. You and the other PCs have the same rival or foe—someone who once tried using magic on you and failed spectacularly.
4. You volunteered because you knew your inherent resistance to magic would be useful to the group.

An Unmagical character shouldn't be able to overcome their inability by becoming trained in magic. The GM might allow them to train away part of the inability with training in specific skills, such as " Onslaught" or "magical weapons."

Playing an  Adept or  Speaker character with the Unmagical descriptor is a challenge, as their abilities mostly stem from supernatural power and therefore all of them would be hindered. This descriptor is mainly for  Warriors and  Explorers who want to play up their not-inherently-magical nature.

#### MODERN MAGIC FLAVORS 

 Flavors are groups of special abilities (usually centered around a particular theme) used to alter a character to suit a player's interests or to match the genre or setting. For example, in a setting where magic is common, access to the magic flavor allows all kinds of characters to learn some magical abilities (including  Explorers and  Warriors, whose  type abilities are mainly nonmagical). Likewise, in a modern fantasy setting where most sorcerers learn basic defensive magic as their first spells, giving all characters access to the  protection flavor means that every PC could potentially create a mind shield or a physical ward when needed.

The following flavors are especially suited for a modern fantasy campaign where access to broad categories of magic (such as illusions or defense) is the norm—especially if the GM allows characters to  spend XP to learn additional spells (abilities) outside of what their type and  focus automatically grant them at each tier. The GM decides which of these flavors are available to the PCs.

-  Charms and Figments (IOM, 70)
-  Cozy Magic (IOM, 71)
-  Divination (IOM, 73)
-  Modern Magic (IOM, 74)
-  Protection (IOM, 76)

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 82)

Cantrips are simple, low-powered spells that almost anyone can learn. In a modern fantasy setting, cantrips can be as ubiquitous and unremarkable as twenty-first-century technology. Instead of using the flashlight function of a smartphone, use a light cantrip. Instead of running a dishwasher or vacuum cleaner, use a cleaning cantrip. Instead of using a megaphone, use a voice-amplifying cantrip.

Cantrips are generally not powerful enough to directly affect an unwilling creature or damage an unattended object. In the rare case that using a cantrip might cause actual harm, change, or  damage, the  attack roll for the cantrip is hindered by two steps (unless otherwise noted).

Any PC can learn two cantrips by spending 2  XP. How they learn them depends on the setting—they might need to study with a mentor, take a specific college class, pay for an informative  ritual, study a magical book, invent it on their own, unlock some previously unrealized potential within themselves, and so on. Learning cantrips does not count toward  character advancement. There is no limit to how many cantrips a PC can learn. In all other respects, cantrips work just like other character abilities.

Unless the theme of the setting is that everyone is quite proficient in magic, it's probably best to limit an individual NPC to knowing just a couple of cantrips, with many people not knowing any at all. A reasonable guideline is that an NPC can know a number of cantrips equal to their level.

**Editor's Notes —** The  Modern Magic flavor suggests an "exchange rate" of four cantrips to one low-tier ability.  It's Only Magic](https://www.montecookgames.com/store/product/its-only-magic/) also suggests the GM might limit the use of cantrips by NPCs (including) [followers) to once or twice per level each day.

##### OPTIONAL RULE: LEARNING CANTRIPS 

In some  fantasy settings, cantrips are commonly available, but not everyone knows how to cast them (in the same way that phone and computer apps are common, but not everyone knows how to code an app). When someone tries to learn a cantrip, have them attempt a level 3 Intellect-based task (skills such as magical lore affect this). If they succeed, they learn the cantrip. If they fail, they don't. A PC only spends the 2  XP to learn cantrips when they succeed at this roll. This way, learning a cantrip isn't automatic—it's more like passing a final exam. And there are ways for the character to "cram" for this test, including expending Effort, getting help, or using an appropriate asset.

The following are examples of typical cantrips in a modern fantasy setting.

- **Bee Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby level 0 bee, housefly, gnat, or similar flying pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins flying around, possibly landing on a creature. The cantrip doesn't work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action. (IOM, 82)
    
- **Bug Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby level 0 spider, cockroach, silverfish, or similar crawling pest to a spot within an immediate distance. The pest acts normally and (appearing in an unfamiliar area) probably begins moving around, possibly crawling on a creature. The cantrip doesn't work if there are no suitable pests within a short distance. Action. (IOM, 82)
    

A level 0 creature isn't a threat to a character and is instantly killed if hit. However, tiny creatures like the ones described in the Bee and Bug cantrips usually have a level 2 modifier for Speed defense because of their size.

- **Candles Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create up to four candle-like lights that move to your mental commands (but no farther away than how far you can reach), lasting about ten minutes. Each light can be a different color. Action. (IOM, 82)
    
- **Chill Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You lower the temperature of a target within short range. If the target is a creature, for the next couple of rounds they feel like they're standing under an air conditioning vent. If the target is an object no larger than a 1-foot (30 cm) cube, you cool it down as if you'd dunked it into a bucket of ice. Action. (IOM, 82)
    

- **Clean Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You remove dirt, mud, and similar substances from one set of clothing (such as the clothes you're wearing), about 1 cubic foot of loose material (clothes, curtains, a box of toys, and so on), or an immediate area on a surface (such as a wall or floor). When used on clothing, this also does a decent job of removing wrinkles. Action. (IOM, 82)
    
- **Color Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the color of an object, or you brighten or dull its color. The object can be up to about 1 cubic foot in size and up to a short distance away. If used to change a creature's hair color, it lasts a few days. Action. (IOM, 83)
    
- **Convenient Rideshare Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** When using a rideshare or taxi app, you are connected with a driver who can pick you up within a couple of minutes. If you use this cantrip in a remote area where drivers are scarce, results can get strange; for example, the car and driver might be ghosts, you might have to share your ride with a dangerous supernatural creature, or you might arrive at your destination minutes before or hours after you were picked up. Action. (IOM, 83)
    

- **Cooking Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You accelerate the preparation and cooking of one dish, reducing the time until it's ready by about ten minutes. (Time-consuming cooking, such as a large turkey, requires multiple castings.) Under normal circumstances, this doesn't burn, overcook, or otherwise ruin the dish. Action. (IOM, 83)
    
- **Cut Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You cut an object up to level 2 as if using a sharp knife or a pair of scissors, up to an immediate distance away. For example, this works on rope, candles, food, cloth, paper, or even a thin wire or thin chain necklace. The object usually gives off harmless blue sparks when it's cut. Action. (IOM, 83)
    

Cut Cantrip isn't hindered by two steps when used to damage an unattended object.

- **Darkness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You suppress light in a cubic or spherical area about 1 foot (30 cm) across within an immediate distance. Outdoors or in bright light, this area becomes very dim; otherwise, it becomes darkness. When you create this area, decide if it remains at a specific location (such as on a desk) or if it is attached to some part of you (such as your head or left hand) and moves with you. The cantrip ends after about a minute. Action. (IOM, 83)
    
- **Erase Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You erase up to a page of text from a typical surface (such as paper, parchment, wood, or plastic) within immediate range. The writing slowly disappears over a few seconds. Affecting magical writing requires an Intellect-based attack roll. Action. (IOM, 83)
    

Erase Cantrip doesn't remove fingerprints, impressions in the paper, or other evidence that writing used to be there.

- **Exterminate Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a bolt of energy that kills one common vermin creature (level 0) within a short distance, such as a fly, worm, cockroach, or mouse. One casting can affect multiple smaller creatures (such as ants or fleas) within 1 cubic foot. The spell is accompanied by a quick bolt of black and yellow energy. Action. (IOM, 83)
    

Exterminate Cantrip is an exception to the rule that trying to  cause direct harm with a cantrip is hindered by two steps. A swarm whose level is 1 or higher is unaffected by this cantrip, even though the individual creatures in the swarm might be.

- **Extra Chair Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** A table you touch somehow has room (and a chair) for one more person to comfortably sit there without affecting anyone else at the table. This lasts anywhere from ten minutes to an hour, or less if the person in the extra chair leaves for more than a few minutes. Action. (IOM, 83)
    
- **Extra Fries Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You update a recent fast food or delivery order so that when it arrives, it includes an additional order of French fries or other side available from the restaurant (tater tots, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and so on). Sometimes this happens for free, and sometimes you have to pay an additional charge. Remember to tip your server. Action. (IOM, 83)
    

- **Fire Crown Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a crown-like manifestation of fire on your head that lasts for ten minutes. The fire doesn't burn you. If anyone touches it or makes a melee attack aimed at your head, you can make a free Intellect-based attack roll against them to inflict 1 point of damage. Action. (IOM, 84)
    

Variants of Fire Crown Cantrip create a crown of lightning, smoke, ice, water, or thorns.

- **Firework Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create an illusory firework within short range, which bursts with sparkling lights and a loud pop. The effect is obviously an illusion but might distract or startle people who aren't expecting it. Action. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Flavor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You touch one plate or bowl of food or one large glass or mug of liquid, improving its flavor. This doesn't affect the nutritional value or texture, nor does it fix spoiled food; it just makes it taste more to your preference (so you could eat spoiled meat or moldy vegetables and they'd taste fine). You decide the sort of flavor change—more or less spicy, salty, savory, sweet, and so on, in any combination appropriate for food or drink. Action. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Forbidden Topic Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** Wards an immediate area (enough to cover a large table at a holiday family gathering) against conversation about a topic of your choice, such as "the election," "Mommy's trial," or "that Cordell kid." Anytime someone in the area attempts to talk about this topic, make an Intellect-based roll against them; success means they either talk about something else or remain silent. The cantrip lasts for ten minutes or until you fail an Intellect-based roll to stop someone from talking about that topic. Action. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Gather Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You gather a scattered bunch of items into a small space, as if you had spent a minute sweeping them together with your hands or a broom. This affects about 1 square yard (1 sq m), up to an immediate distance away. The cantrip is mainly useful for collecting things that have been spilled, or for making it easier to clean up a room. Action. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Ghostly Wings Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You sprout a pair of ghostly wings that immediately unfurl, then vanish a few seconds later. If you cast this cantrip while falling, you reduce the damage from the fall by 1 point. Enabler. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Green Light Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You tweak the traffic lights at an intersection within long range so that one of them turns green within a few seconds. The other lights in that system automatically adjust to compensate (turning yellow and then red for cross traffic). Depending on that traffic system, the light remains green anywhere from about ten seconds to a minute. Enabler. (IOM, 84)
    
- **Hand Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You levitate or manipulate an object of 10 pounds (4.5 kg) or less at up to a short distance. The effect is not particularly strong—about the same strength as trying to push, pull, or twist something just using the strength of your hand (without your arm). Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Hide Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You conceal one target within immediate range for about a minute. The target can be no larger than a typical rabbit, or several objects no larger than dice. The target is basically invisible to anyone in front of you, but the illusion doesn't work on anyone to your side or behind you. (If someone is intent on seeing the invisible target, make an Intellect-based attack roll against them to hide it from their view.) Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Light Switch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You toggle up to four light controls (such as a wall switch or a lamp's button, knob, or pull cord) within short range. You must be able to see these light controls or have a clear idea of where they are (such as turning on your front porch light and living room floor lamp from outside your home). You can toggle these switches on or off in any combination. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Loudness Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You amplify your voice, allowing you to speak at up to three times your normal volume. This isn't enough to harm anyone, but you can speak comfortably to a large crowd or across a very long distance without effort. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Mask Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a costume mask on the face of a creature you touch. The mask can be simple (like a domino mask), fancy (like a masquerade ball mask), or deceptive (like a Halloween costume mask of a monster or specific person). The mask is obviously just a mask, not a disguise, but a deceptive mask viewed from at least a short distance away might fool someone into thinking it's a real face, providing an asset to disguise tasks at this range. The mask lasts for about a minute. If removed, the mask immediately disappears. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Mending Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You touch a broken object of up to level 3 and attempt to magically repair a single break or tear in it, such as a cracked stone wall, a shattered hand mirror, or a torn piece of clothing. The damage can be no larger than about what you can cover with both of your open hands. If you succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the object's level, you repair it (although it still shows signs of being previously broken, and may be fragile there). You can use this ability multiple times on the same object to repair larger breaks. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Message Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You whisper a short message (about five to ten seconds) to a creature you can see within a long distance. The target hears it as if you had whispered it in their ear. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Mystic Eyes Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the appearance of your eyes. If you just change their color to a different hue (such as to blue, green, or brown), the change lasts for an hour. If you change them to something unusual, such as red, yellow, solid black, or glowing, it only lasts for a minute. Action. (IOM, 85)
    
- **Obedient Flames Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You affect flames within a short distance, making them appear brighter or dimmer, flicker strangely, or change color. This lasts for one minute. You can affect up to several dozen candles, a few torches, or one typical campfire with each casting of the cantrip. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Open and Close Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You open or close a small object within short range, such as a bag, box, bottle, footlocker, window, or lightweight door. This cantrip cannot lock or unlock locks. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Pen Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You write with your finger on a surface for up to ten minutes as if using a common ballpoint pen. The "ink" immediately dries once you write, but it can be smeared or cleaned up like a normal pen. The ink is blue, black, or dark brown, decided when you cast this cantrip. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Present Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You teleport an object within an immediate distance into your upturned hand. The item has to be something you're carrying (such as a gem in your pouch or a dagger in your boot), something you can see (such as a coffee cup or mobile phone on the other side of the table), or something you know is within range (such as a note you saw someone put in their pocket). The cantrip affects one small object (for example, a cup or mobile phone) or up to a dozen smaller items from the same location (perhaps coins or dice). Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Quiet Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You muffle the noise from one target within a short distance for a few seconds. Breaking a window or knocking a glass off the table would be no louder than someone tapping their finger on the glass. An obnoxious security alarm would only be as loud as a computer speaker. A ringing phone would be barely audible. If you cast this on a willing creature, they gain an asset on stealth tasks for one round if they move no more than an immediate distance on their turn. Action. (IOM, 86)
    

Affecting an unwilling creature (or something they're carrying) with an ability requires an attack roll to succeed. If you're using a cantrip, by default that attack roll is hindered by two steps.

- **Rainbow Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a softly glowing band of colors resembling a rainbow, extending from your hand to an object or willing creature within short range. The far end doesn't move (a creature could move away from it by going around a corner or out of range). You can anchor your end in place or allow it to move when your hand moves. The rainbow gives off light like a candle and lasts about a minute. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Reshape Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You change the shape of a metal, glass, or stone object you touch into a different shape. For example, you could turn a coin into a ring, a cup into a plate, or a piece of glass into something resembling a gemstone. This normally lasts about a minute, but the object tends to revert early if anyone else touches or examines it too closely. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Smoke Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a harmless puff of smoke within an immediate distance. The smoke fills about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and dissipates over the next few rounds. You decide if the smoke is white, grey, blue, brown, green, red, or yellow. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Sprout Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You make seeds sprout at an accelerated rate, causing a week's worth of growth to happen in just a few moments. The seeds must be within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube and no more than an immediate distance from you. If the seeds are in viable soil, they take root as if planted there. If cast on immature or closed flowers, they bloom. If cast on a piece of unripe fruit, it immediately ripens. Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Stitch Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You sew two touched pieces of cloth or thin leather together, up to about 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). The stitches are of the same quality of hand stitching by a tailor or leatherworker of reasonable skill. You choose the path of the stitches, so you could create a piece of clothing by casting this cantrip several times. Instead of sewing together two items, you can unravel the stitches of a touched object, affecting up to 2 square yards (1.5 sq m). Action. (IOM, 86)
    
- **Tattoo Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create an image on your skin, as if tattooed there by a reasonably talented artist. The image can be no larger than your hand, and consists of just one color. You can cast this cantrip multiple times to create a larger tattoo, use more colors, or both. The image lasts about an hour. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Throwing Stone Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You summon a nearby object of stone, brick, concrete, cement, asphalt, or a similar hard and common mineral to your hand. The cantrip doesn't work if there are no suitable loose materials within a short distance. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Tie Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You control a piece of string, rope, or twine within short range, causing it to tie itself to another object within 1 foot (30 cm) of it, using any sort of simple, common knot (such as a square knot). Instead of tying a knot, you can cast this cantrip on a simple knot within short range, untying it. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Tiny Illusion Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You create a single image of a creature or object within immediate range. The image must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. The image can move (for example, you could make the illusion of a mouse jump or crawl around), but it can't leave the area defined by the cube. The illusion includes sound (up to the volume of a person's normal speaking voice) but not smell. It lasts for one minute, but if you want to change the original illusion significantly—such as making a creature appear to be wounded— you must concentrate on it again (though doing so doesn't cost additional Intellect points). If you move beyond immediate range of the cube, the illusion vanishes. Action to create; action to modify. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Tremor Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You make the ground or floor vibrate within a short area, feeling similar to a mild earthquake. Other objects on the floor might vibrate or slide (no more than a hand's span) because of this vibration. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Warm Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You raise the temperature in a very small area (about 1 cubic foot) within short range, enough to make someone's face feel flushed or warm a drink to about the temperature of freshly served coffee. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Wash Car Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You clean the outside of a typical passenger automobile within immediate range as if it had gone through an automatic car wash. Very large or very dirty cars may require multiple castings. The cantrip works on motorcycles, bicycles, and other small vehicles as well. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Wet or Dry Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You alter the moisture level of an object or area within immediate range, affecting about a 1-foot (30 cm) cube or one set of clothing. If you want the target to be wetter, it is dampened as if you poured a cup of water on it. If you want it drier, it is dried as if you hung it out in the sun on a warm day. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Wireless Network Cantrip (1 Intellect point):** You improve wireless network reception in an immediate area for ten minutes. This improves poor or average reception to full strength and zero bars to at least one bar. When you cast this cantrip, you decide if this improved reception affects everyone in the area or just you. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Wrap (1 Intellect point):** You use available materials to wrap up an object within an immediate distance. The wrapped object must fit within a 1-foot (30 cm) cube. For example, you could wrap a gift box with decorative paper, wrap a piece of paper around a letter to create an envelope, or wrap a pile of potatoes with burlap to create an easily carried bundle. Action. (IOM, 87)
    
- **Youth (1 Intellect point):** You change the appearance of your face so you look about ten years younger than your normal appearance, lasting about an hour. Action. (IOM, 87)

#### COVENS 

##### QUICK REFERENCE: COVENS 

-  Joining a Coven (IOM, 88)
-  Coven Talismans (IOM, 89)
-  Advancing Within a Coven (IOM, 89)
-  Breaking From a Coven (IOM, 89)
-  Forming a New Coven (IOM, 89)
-  Selecting Coven Abilities (IOM, 89)

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 88)

Magic is a community affair, and magicians are more powerful in groups. A coven is a group of three or more magicians with similar goals and values, supporting each other and working together to hone their craft. Forming or joining a coven grants characters additional abilities, which you gain separately from the standard advancement track. When you join a coven, you start at rank 1 within that coven, and over time can advance to rank 6. Rank is a measurement of your connection to the coven, and doesn't necessarily correspond to your character tier—for example, a high-tier character might have a low rank in their coven. However, your coven rank cannot exceed your character tier.

The primary magical benefit of joining a coven is gaining access to its spells: a set of character  abilities that all members (of the required rank) can use. These spells are usually tailored to the coven's interests and purpose, and are sorted by rank from 1 to 6. Because a character's rank within a coven starts at 1 when they join, a new member of a coven has access to the coven's rank 1 spell. When the character advances to rank 2, they immediately gain access to the coven's rank 2 spell, and so on.

You can think of covens as similar to  flavors, in that they allow the GM and players to modify characters with abilities. Unlike choosing an ability from a flavor, a character doesn't have to trade away or swap anything to choose or use a coven spell—they have access to these spells automatically according to their rank in the coven. For example, if the rank 1 spell for the _Benevolent Bakers_ uses the  Resist the Elements ability (handy for working over a hot stove all day), any character who joins the Benevolent Bakers automatically gains Resist the Elements, without having to spend extra XP to learn it or trade away a  type ability for it.

It's possible for a character to belong to multiple covens, as long as the covens don't have opposed goals. Characters advance their rank in each coven separately, so a particular character might be rank 1 in the _Chronographers_ and rank 3 in the _Foretellers_.

If a character leaves or is removed from their coven, they immediately lose access to all of that coven's spells.

For magician NPCs in a coven, the GM can assume that their rank is equal to their NPC level (with a maximum of 6).

**Editor's Notes —** Covens provide a model for reputation-based progression with all kinds of secret societies, mystic orders, or unique factions.

##### JOINING A COVEN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 88)

Joining an existing coven at rank 1 requires a vow and a  ritual. Characters must commit to pursuing the coven's goals and living in accordance with its values. The ritual is a demonstration of dedication to the coven's purpose, and varies in difficulty accordingly. Characters receive their  talisman once the ritual is complete.

###### COVEN TALISMANS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 89)

A coven talisman is a small item, such as a pendant or ring, that represents a character's affiliation with the coven. Every coven member may carry a slightly different talisman, but they should be clearly related. The _Benevolent Bakers_' talismans might include a necklace, a pin, and a keychain, all with the same whisk design.

Coven talismans are a type of  artifact, with a level equal to the character's rank within the coven and a depletion of "—." The talisman is what allows the character to use their  coven abilities; if the talisman isn't on the character's person or within short range, all of the character's coven magic is hindered by two steps. When a person  advances within the coven, the talisman's appearance may change to reflect this. While these talismans don't require a depletion roll with each use, a character's coven talisman automatically depletes if they break from the coven.

##### ADVANCING WITHIN A COVEN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 89)

Advancing within a coven is a separate matter from  advancing a character. In fact, coven advancement is more similar to a  long-term benefit of  spending XP. Coven advancement should occur after a character has learned, discovered, or achieved something that aligns with the coven's mission and values.

To advance within the coven, the player spends 3  XP. Characters may mark the occasion with a celebration or let it pass quietly.

Spending  XP to advance a character's rank in a coven does not count as one of the four  character advancements needed to reach a higher tier.

##### BREAKING FROM A COVEN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 89)

If a character wishes to leave a coven, they relinquish their coven talisman and lose access to their coven abilities. But a character can also break from their coven by behaving in opposition to its values—such as if a _Benevolent Baker_ were to knowingly poison someone. This causes their  coven talisman to become depleted, meaning that they can no longer use their coven abilities.

To restore their place in the coven, a disgraced character must begin by making amends with the other members. They then take their coven talisman to an epicenter and perform a  ritual with a difficulty equal to their former coven rank. Upon completing the ritual, they regain that rank within the coven and can access spells accordingly.

##### FORMING A NEW COVEN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 89)

Creating a new coven simply requires a bit of discussion among the GM and players. Begin by deciding on the following:

- What's the coven called?
- What are one or two goals for the coven's magic? What do they want to learn how to do? What skill do the players want the coven to be known for?
- What are a few succinct values? What do the players agree are the most important things a magician can be? Competent? Fair? Determined? Kind? Loyal? Wealthy?
- What does the  coven talisman look like?
- What does the initiation  ritual (which exemplifies the coven's goals and values) consist of?

##### SELECTING COVEN ABILITIES 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 89)

Coven abilities are chosen by the GM and players. To start, they need to decide the rank 1 ability. They can determine the rank 2 ability when at least one character is ready to advance within the coven. In a longer campaign, selecting abilities on an ongoing basis—rather than choosing them all at once—means that the players can choose their next coven ability based on what obstacles they expect their characters to face.

 Chapter 9: Abilities divides abilities by both category and power level, which is helpful in narrowing down your options. Choose a low-tier ability for ranks 1 and 2, a mid-tier ability for ranks 3 and 4, and a high-tier ability for ranks 5 and 6.

Because covens form around unifying goals and principles, coven abilities should stack upon each other wherever possible. A coven of entomologists learning to summon and control leaf bugs might progress from  Influence Swarm at rank 1 to  Control Swarm at rank 2,  Call Swarm at rank 3, and so on, eventually reaching  Insect Eruption at rank 6. Don't be afraid to be specific! Joining a coven gives characters the opportunity to become experts in a narrow field.

If a pre-existing ability doesn't capture what the players and GM are looking for, the GM is always free to create new ones. To return to the example of the _Benevolent Bakers_, no abilities in  Chapter 9: Abilities specifically pertain to making food, but the bakers could modify an ability like  Natural Crafter to suit their needs.

#### FAMILIARS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 94)

In the most general sense, a familiar is a creature (usually in the form of a small animal) bonded to a magical person as a companion. However, a familiar's role, intelligence, relationship with their person, powers, and vulnerabilities vary greatly from setting to setting. A familiar might be just a pet or comfort animal, with no special abilities. They might have an empathic or telepathic connection with their person. They might be an extension of the person's soul, with harm to the familiar causing harm to the person. They might be a fully supernatural creature, able to assist with magical tasks or provide advice. A magical world might only have one of these kinds of familiars, or any of them.

**CONTENT WARNING:** This section talks about the death of pets.

##### STANDARD PET 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 94)

The simplest sort of familiar is one that is a normal animal that has an emotional bond with a character, essentially the same role as a typical pet or comfort animal. The familiar has no special abilities, doesn't affect the character's magical abilities in any way, and is not meant to help in combat. Their death doesn't cause the character physical harm (although it probably causes emotional harm, just like the loss of any pet), and the character can gain a new familiar after a certain amount of time. For this type of familiar, a character should choose the  Critter Companion ability, which gives them a level 1 creature.

If the character wants a bigger or tougher creature that is otherwise still a normal animal, they should choose  Beast Companion, which gives them a level 2 creature, but otherwise works the same as Critter Companion.

As a slightly more magical variant, choose either of these abilities, but instead of finding a replacement for the creature if it dies, the character can perform a  magical ritual (taking 1d6 days) to return them to life.

###### UNUSUAL FAMILIARS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 94)

There's no reason a familiar has to resemble a common Earth animal such as a cat, frog, or hawk. If the setting is a world other than Earth, and it has its own animal species that don't exist on Earth (such as monkey-lizards, capybara-bats, and raven snakes), those kinds of creatures are valid choices for a familiar.

If a familiar is a creature whose body is created by the bond with a magician (instead of an existing beast that the character finds and binds with magic), the GM could allow a familiar to look like an extinct animal, such as a dodo bird or _Compsognathus_ dinosaur, or even a permanently miniature version of a large creature such as an elephant or rhinoceros.

History and fantasy literature has suggested other forms for familiars, such as fiendish-looking imps, tiny dragons, alchemy-crafted homunculi, fairies, intelligent floating skulls, and spirits resembling human children. Exactly what sorts of unusual familiars are available in the setting is up to the GM, but their appearance generally doesn't affect their game statistics. For example, a flying skull familiar and a bat familiar probably have the same  level, movement, and modifiers.

##### MAGICAL FAMILIARS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 95)

This kind of familiar is more of a magical creature than a standard pet. Advantages compared to a standard pet are the familiar's ability to be physical or intangible, its telepathic connection to the character, and (unlike a standard pet familiar) the fact that it can't truly die. The disadvantages of this kind of familiar are that they cannot travel too far away from you and they spend most of their time asleep and intangible instead of actively assisting you. For this type of familiar, a character should choose the  Bound Magic Familiar ability.

##### SOULBOUND FAMILIARS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 95)

This is the most powerful and versatile kind of familiar. They have significant magical abilities, but this requires a bond between the character and familiar that makes them both vulnerable in certain ways.

For this type of familiar, a character should choose the  Soul Familiar ability.

##### MODIFYING A FAMILIAR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 95)

The following character abilities can be used to improve your familiar or the connection you have with it. (Although most of the ability descriptions refer to the  Beast Companion ability, they have the same effect on a familiar as on a beast companion.)

- Tier 3:  Stronger Together
- Tier 4:  Beast Eyes
- Tier 5:  Improved Companion
- Tier 6:  As If One Creature

---

#### MODERN FANTASY EQUIPMENT 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 78)

In a modern fantasy setting, the following items (and anything else appropriate to a  modern Earthlike world) are usually available. As with most physical things, a character can spend more for a higher-quality version of an item, such as an expensive altar cloth instead of a moderately priced one. Some of these price categories are higher than for a typical real-world item because items used with magic usually require higher quality or specific materials.

Many items in these lists are magical implements used with casting spells and performing  rituals, but don't have a specific purpose in the rules. The GM may decide that certain abilities or kinds of abilities require them or are hindered without them, such as using a crystal ball for a scrying spell, an athame for a protection spell, or a spirit board for a ritual to talk to a dead person.

#### MODERN FANTASY CRAFTING INGREDIENTS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 79)

An inferior example of a crafting ingredient counts as one price category lower. A superior example counts as one or more  price categories higher.

Often, a material with sentimental value to the magician is worth one price category more than its default value.

#### MODERN FANTASY CYPHERS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 115)

 Chapter 24: Cyphers assumes that  subtle cyphers are the default, but depending on the nature of magic in the modern fantasy setting, some or all cyphers might be physical objects ( manifest cyphers) with magical powers. This immediately creates a different gameplay dynamic than a game that uses only subtle cyphers. First, it means that the PCs can exchange cyphers with each other, allowing them better optimizations of their abilities and counteracting their weaknesses. Second, it means their cyphers can be stolen from them, forcing them to adapt to a situation without their extra magical tricks. Third, it probably means that  fantastic cyphers become the norm because magic easily allows for fantastic effects.

##### EXCEEDING CYPHER LIMITS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 92)

Sometimes characters might want or need to carry more than their normal allotment of cyphers, and in a modern fantasy game it's fun to let the overlapping cypher auras (or whatever the cause) create odd side effects. Typically, a side effect stops or reverts if the cypher is activated or leaves the area. If a PC is exceeding their cypher limit, roll 1d100 and consult this table to see what happens (roll anywhere from once per hour to once per day, as fits the story). The table is set up so the first entries are weird but generally harmless, the middle ones are annoying, and the last ones are harmful or dangerous. Optionally, you can increase the threat by adding +20 to the d00 roll for every additional cypher the character is over their limit (+20 for two over, +40 for three over, and so on).

###### ABSOLUTE POWER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** App, battery, bone
    
- **Effect:** Powers a single device for a day. The device can be as simple as a cell phone or as complex as a jet airplane, as long as the device's power requirement is equal to or less than the cypher level. In general, something like a cell phone is a level 1 power requirement, a boat engine is a level 5 power requirement, and a jet airplane is a level 10 power requirement.
    

###### ALGOMANCY 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** App, bookmark, tarot card
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to take anything driven by an algorithm (such as video and music services, social media, search engines, and so on) and use it to divine the future. If the user spends one roundstudying the algorithm, then for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain limited precognition and can predict what's going to happen next. They gain an asset on initiative tasks and all defense rolls. In addition, they can warn their friends of what's coming, and ease their friends' next action.
    

###### AMBIANCE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Key fob, feather, DVD
    
- **Effect:** Allows you to control the lights, sound, and other atmospheric elements within any space that you are in for ten minutes per cypher level. This includes adjusting non-adjustable lights, lighting or blowing out candles, soundproofing, starting or stopping music through any available medium, starting a fire, and so on.
    

###### ANYWHERE WEB 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Spiderweb, key fob, key
    
- **Effect:** Allows you to access and interact with the internet from anywhere, without needing any type of physical device, including a phone, keyboard, or screen. You can see the internet as if there were a screen in front of you, type as if there were a keyboard, hear as if there were speakers, and speak as if into a microphone. Others you choose within immediate range can also see and hear what you are seeing and hearing (but cannot interact with it). This works even in places where there is no internet connectivity and lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### BELOW THE LAW 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** App, temporary tattoo, patch
    
- **Effect:** Once activated, the cypher makes it difficult for any member of the law or people in a position of power to perceive, apprehend, or punish you. This includes police, guards, the mayor, mob bosses, regular bosses, and so on. All tasks involving illegal or unsanctioned activities are eased, including stealing, sneaking, getting away, escaping bonds, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### BEST GIFT 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Granny square, key, candle
    
- **Effect:** The user picks someone they know, and the cypher transforms into a beautifully wrapped box that person can hold in their hand. Inside the box is a small, thoughtful gift (whose value does not exceed a  moderately priced  item) that the recipient will truly love.
    

###### BEVERAGE BESTIE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 119)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, mug, charm
    
- **Effect:** The user picks someone they know, and that person will have their favorite morning beverage delivered to them at their bedside at the exact moment they are ready for it. The user doesn't need to know their chosen person's favorite beverage, their location, or when they will wish for it—the magic takes care of it.
    

###### BORROWED FAMILIAR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Feather, cat's whisker, figurine of a dog
    
- **Effect:** Activating the cypher creates a living version of the creature it represented. This creature is actually the clone of another magic user's familiar that was stored in the object. For the next day per cypher level, the creature becomes the user's temporary familiar, providing an asset to all magic-related actions (including defense actions). The creature cannot be harmed, but at the end of its time, it fades away.
    

###### BRAIN OVERCLOCK 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** App, mushroom, hair clip
    
- **Effect:** Amplifies the user's mental abilities so their senses are keener and their brain works far beyond its normal capacity.
    
    Roll for effect:
    

Brain Overclock Effects
|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Increases Intellect Edge by 1 for one hour|
|2|Trained in Intellect Defense for one hour|
|3|Add +1 damage to all Intellect-based attacks for one hour|
|4|Eases all Intellect-based attacks for one hour|
|5|Restores Intellect Pool to full|
|6|Become trained in two noncombat Intellect skills for one hour|

###### BURN YOUR BRIDGES 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, candle, bones
    
- **Effect:** Covers and destroys the user's trail in such a way that it makes them very hard to follow. This might include covering their scent, destroying ladders or bridges, creating face-recognition distortion, blurring their license plate, or establishing a false trail. Anyone attempting to follow or track them for one day per cypher level finds their actions hindered by two steps.
    

###### BURNER PHONE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Key fob, charm, hair clip
    
- **Effect:** Creates or transforms into a basic mobile phone that can make and receive telephone calls and text messages like a prepaid phone. Calls and texts made from this phone appear as "UNKNOWN CALLER" with the number obscured; once contacted, the recipient can call or text this phone like any other phone. The phone uses normal (prepaid) cellular connections, but has no internet access or other functions other than sending and receiving calls and texts.
    
    The phone lasts for one hour per cypher level, after which it becomes inert, nonfunctional, and untrackable (like a mobile phone that has been broken and its chip removed). The user of the cypher can end it early as an action by speaking a command word or physically breaking it.
    

###### CLOAK OF THE CRAFTER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Oil, moss, granny square
    
- **Effect:** When activated, it cloaks the user in what looks like a handmade wrap, such as a shawl, scarf, or cloak, for an hour per cypher level. During that time, the user's crafting-related tasks are eased, and everything they craft is one level higher than it normally would be. In addition, the user can find up to two ingredients they need (up to the level of the cypher) in the pockets of the cloak.
    

###### DANCING ON AIR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 120)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Feather, bullet, charm
    
- **Effect:** The user is lifted a foot (30 cm) or so off the ground, as if there is a pocket of air between them and whatever surface is below them. They can move normally as if walking across a smooth, flat surface. This works even if the substance below them would not normally hold them, such as water or thin ice. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### DUMPSTER FIRE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Matchbook, coaster, rope
    
- **Effect:** Instantly transforms to become a large, contained fire that creates a deep feeling of gloom and despair in all creatures chosen by the user within long range of it who fail an Intellect defense roll. Any negative actions the user takes against those creatures (including combat) are eased by one step, and any positive actions they take for those creatures (such as attempting to inspire them) are hindered by one step.
    

###### DUPLICITY WINDOW 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Sticker, flyer, stamp
    
- **Effect:** When this cypher is stuck on any window or other transparent item, the user can alter what can be seen from the other side. While this illusion might be used in a simple way, such as creating a blackout window on a car, it could also be much more complex, such as creating an elaborate dance party inside an otherwise empty apartment. The illusion level is equal to the cypher level and fools the vision of living creatures as well as that of magical and electronic eyes. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### EXCEPTIONAL ENGINE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Herbs, battery, flip lighter
    
- **Effect:** When activated near an engine, computer, device, program, or piece of machinery, the affected target works exceptionally well for the next ten minutes per cypher level, easing all tasks involved with operating it. For example, a car handles better, a hacking program works faster, an elevator door closes before a pursuer can get on, and so on.
    

###### EXTROVERT SHIELD 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Carved figure, bones, building blocks
    
- **Effect:** Creates the semblance of a being of the user's choice, such as a human who walks beside them, a bird that sits on their shoulders, or a robot, to act as their shield in social situations. The first time they would take damage from a mental attack, the being absorbs that damage (up to the cypher level) and reflects it back onto the attacker; the user makes an Intellect-based attack roll for this reflected damage. After that, the being disappears.
    

###### FADE TO BLACK 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Mirror, lapel pin, spiderweb
    
- **Effect:** Turns the user into a shadow for ten minutes per cypher level. During that time, the user looks exactly like their own shadow, is two-dimensional, and can move through any space where light could shine through. As a shadow, the user can make magical attacks but not physical ones. They take no physical damage. However, any successful magical attacks against them inflict +1 point of damage.
    

###### FARADAY WARD 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** App, pocket handkerchief, lapel pin
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the ward protects the user, their items, and their devices from any attempts at scrying, electromagnetic surveillance, and similar observation whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### FEY COLLAR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 121)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Collar, knitted scarf, necklace
    
- **Effect:** When placed around a creature's neck, the collar locks and prevents the wearer from using magic of any kind (up to the level of the cypher). If the creature is a PC, each time they try to use magic they must succeed at an Intellect-based roll against the cypher level; otherwise that attempt is blocked. The collar lasts for ten minutes per cypher level and then disintegrates.
    

###### GHOST TAG 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Spray paint, feather, lipstick
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to leave their tag on someone else's graffiti, painting, or public artwork. The tag includes a spoken message up to twenty words long and is invisible except to the creature the user designates. That creature can touch the tag and hear the entirety of the message.
    

###### GIRL MOSS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Mushroom, chalk, seed packet
    
- **Effect:** The user melds into whatever soft thing is near them, such as moss, earth, or a blanket, and becomes nearly indistinguishable from that thing. For a number of rounds equal to the cypher level, they gain an asset to hiding, sneaking, and remaining undetected (even by magic). Entering into combat or interacting with another creature in any way breaks the effect.
    

###### GOT YOUR BACK 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Napkin, straw, coaster
    
- **Effect:** The cypher turns bright blue in the presence of any type of drug, poison, or other detrimental or dangerous substance whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level. The effect lasts for one day.
    

###### GRAVITY DENIED 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, feather, balloon
    
- **Effect:** The user no longer has to follow gravity's laws. For one minute per cypher level, they can walk (or crawl or run) on steep inclines and horizontal surfaces (such as walls and cliffs) as if they were on flat ground. When using this ability, "down" for them is either the surface they are walking on or the normal orientation of gravity (their choice).
    

###### GREAT HAIR DAY 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Hair clip, twigs, bones
    
- **Effect:** When activated, the cypher makes the user's hair look like it did on their best hair day ever. For the next 24 hours, they have an asset in all confidence-based actions, social and otherwise.
    

###### GROWWELL 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Herbs, seed packet, bouquet of flowers
    
- **Effect:** Causes a garden to sprout in any immediate area. The garden is self-sustaining and doesn't need soil, sun, or water. It includes flowers, vegetables, and herbs, and lasts for a number of months equal to the cypher level.
    

###### HAND WAVE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 122)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Fingerless glove, ring, temporary tattoo
    
- **Effect:** When the user places this cypher upon their hand as an action, they can take three actions on their next turn.
    

###### HASHTAG 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, flyer, electronic stylus
    
- **Effect:** The user chooses a word or short phrase when activating this cypher. For an hour per cypher level, that word will glow when they encounter it in their environment in a way that only they can perceive, allowing them to pick it out from its surroundings easily. This glow will appear around the word itself as well as symbols and objects. For example, if they choose "apple," they will sense a glow around the word in print, around an actual apple, and around the symbol of an apple logo on a computer. This doesn't extend their range of vision farther than they can normally see.
    
    This cypher adjusts to be beneficial to the user. For example, if a non-sighted character uses hashtag, the cypher might create a sound or sensation around the chosen word rather than a glow, or the glow might be visible in their mind's eye instead.
    

###### HERE ALL ALONG 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** App, needle and thread, ID card
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to instantly create a long trail on the internet for someone that they just made up. This includes social media accounts, a personal or business website, photos and videos, friends, and so on. The information stays on the internet forever.
    

###### INSTANT AUTOMOBILE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Key, charm, temporary tattoo
    
- **Effect:** Creates or transforms into a large automobile that can carry up to eight people. The user or other characters must steer the automobile as normal. At cypher level 5 and higher, the automobile grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the automobile can move a short distance each round under its own power. The automobile lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.
    

The vehicle created by an instant automobile cypher is utilitarian and unremarkable rather than flashy, more like a station wagon, generic van, panel truck, or SUV. In some settings, local laws might require these temporary magical vehicles to have a specific color or text to easily identify them as such, including a unique license plate that can be tracked like any registered vehicle. Likewise, an instant motorcycle cypher creates a functional but not particularly "sexy" motorbike.

###### INSTANT DELIVERY 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** App, feather, stamp
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to have a letter, small package, or any object up to about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) delivered almost instantaneously to someone. If the object is dangerous, such as a bomb, the recipient's level must be equal to or less than the cypher's. The user must know the person's name and at least one small fact about them, but doesn't need to know their location. Within a round of having left the user, the package will arrive within a short distance of the recipient.
    

###### INSTANT MOTORCYCLE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Playing card, key, metal flask
    
- **Effect:** Creates or transforms into a motorcycle that can comfortably carry one person (or two people sitting tandem). The user or other characters must steer the motorcycle as normal. At cypher level 4 and higher, the motorcycle grants an asset on all tasks relating to its movement, and at cypher level 7 and higher, the motorcycle can move a short distance each round under its own power. The motorcycle lasts for a day, after which it vanishes.
    

###### LIE TO ME 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Contact lenses, goggles, mask
    
- **Effect:** Once activated and worn, allows the user to see through all deceptions, mirages, and illusions (up to the level of the cypher) for a day. Also provides the user with an asset on lying, cheating, illusions, and other deception tasks.
    

###### LIGHT 'EM UP 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 123)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Laser light pointer, pair of glasses, key fob
    
- **Effect:** Activating the cypher causes a powerful beam of magic light to erupt from the user's body part they choose. The beam stretches a short range and inflicts damage equal to the cypher level. It affects even creatures (such as ghosts and vampires) that normally can't be harmed by mundane weapons. Once activated, the weapon is active for ten minutes.
    

###### LUCKY CHARM 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Worry stone, fuzzy dice, deck of cards
    
- **Effect:** Rubbing the lucky charm draws a tiny bit of luck away from someone else and gives it to the user, causing something to happen that makes the user's next action a little easier. This might be a friend showing up, a tool appearing just where the user needs it, or the traffic lights changing to green just as the user arrives. Effectively, using this cypher grants the player a  player intrusion without having to spend 1  XP.
    

###### MAGIC AURA TRACKER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, bus ticket, 3D glasses
    
- **Effect:** User can view the cypher's symbols to see if the ambient power of magic in the area is normal, high (increased capabilities or prone to disruptive surges), low (decreased effects or scarcity), or absent. It can also be configured to display power levels for individual kinds of magic (fire, necromancy, illusion) separately from the standard readings. This lasts for five hours per cypher level.
    

###### MENTAL LOAD ALLEVIATOR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Worry stone, pen, figurine
    
- **Effect:** Helps take on some of the user's mental loads for the next day, including creating shopping lists, organizing the calendar, project management, working on spells, and decision making. During this time, the user gains +1 to their Intellect Edge and +5 to their Intellect Pool (+7 to their Intellect Pool if the cypher is level 9 or higher).
    

###### MERCIFUL MEMORY 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Candle, charm, 3D glasses
    
- **Effect:** For one willing target (including the user), the user can alter a negative memory into one that's mor positive. Altering the memory takes a few rounds, depending on the intricacy and difficulty of the memory. Once the memory is altered, it remains that way for a day. During that time, the target gains +5 to their Intellect Pool and all tasks involving the memory (such as talking to the person the memory's about) are eased.
    

###### NEXT YOU 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Comb, mirror, hair pin
    
- **Effect:** Activating the cypher brings up a magical avatar of the user. The user can alter all parts of their avatar, include hair color and style, clothing, jewelry, makeup, gender, height, and so on. After one round, the changes they've made to the avatar are made to their own body. The effect lasts for one hour per cypher level.
    

###### NO TAKE BACKS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 124)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Temporary tattoo, playing card, skein of yarn
    
- **Effect:** Activating the cypher creates an invisible bubble around the user. The next time a foe inflicts damage on the user, the bubble registers the type of attack (such as melee, magic, or ranged) and alters itself to protect the user from the next attack of that type. When the user would next take damage from the same type of attack, the bubble absorbs all of it and then pops.
    

###### PICKPOCKET 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** App, stone, key fob
    
- **Effect:** The next time the user attempts to pickpocket someone, they automatically succeed against a target whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's, and they gain an asset to their task against targets whose level is higher than the cypher's. In addition to the items the target has in their pocket, the user gains a random cypher (of a level equal to or less than the level of the pickpocket cypher).
    

###### POCKET PROTECTOR 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Metal flask, flip lighter, book
    
- **Effect:** If the user is shot with a bullet, arrow, or other projectile, the cypher just happens to be in the right place to protect them from all damage. Unlike a standard cypher, this protective effect occurs without the user's action to activate it. Once used to protect against one attack chosen by the user, the cypher turns to dust.
    

###### PORTAL STONE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Stone, marble, baseball
    
- **Effect:** Placing an object beneath the portal stone and letting it rest there for one round shifts it to an undiscoverable location, such as another dimension or world (depending on the setting). The item can only be retrieved by holding the portal stone and whispering the name of the object.
    

###### POWER DEVICE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** App, flip lighter, seed packet
    
- **Effect:** Magically powers one device that can fit within an area a short distance across. The device is now fully powered, charged, or fueled. If the cypher is used on an automobile, for example, the gas tank is full. If used on a flashlight, the battery is fully charged.
    

###### POWER HOUSE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Stone, wood, building box
    
- **Effect:** Expands into an instant tiny home complete with a washroom, sleeping area, and kitchen space. The entirety of the structure is about 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 feet (6 m by 6 m by 3.5 m). It lasts for 24 hours, at which point it and all nonliving things inside it disintegrate.
    

###### PRESTO CHANGE-O 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Skein of yarn, key fob, key
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to alter the appearance of a single vehicle whose level is equal to or less than the cypher level for the next day. This could be a minor alteration, such as changing the paint color and the license plate number, or it could be a major one, such as changing a horse-drawn carriage into a go-kart. The new vehicle must be able to traverse the same type of terrain as the original (the user can change a canoe into a speedboat, for example, but not into a plane or a race car).
    

###### PUZZLE BOX 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Building block, flip lighter, locket
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to put a creature (up to the level of the cypher) inside an item the user touches with the cypher. The creature shrinks to fit inside the item. While inside the item, the creature is in stasis and cannot take any actions. They cannot be harmed in any way and they do not experience time moving forward. The creature stays inside permanently, unless they are released by magic or until the user chooses to let them out.
    

###### QUICK PIC 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 125)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** App, pen, stone with a hole in it
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to snap a quick image of whatever they point it at. The image stays perfectly in their mind for the next 24 hours. By touching an appropriate device, they can download the image, print it out, or digitally alter it. At the end of 24 hours, all versions of the image, including the one in their head, disappear.
    

###### QUICK PICKUP 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, key, fidget toy
    
- **Effect:** For a number of hours equal to the cypher level, anytime the user needs a ride somewhere, one instantly appears. This could be a rideshare, a city bike, a horse, a canoe, a friend with a car, a helicopter, or something else, as the GM determines.
    

###### REAL FAKE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, playing card, ticket
    
- **Effect:** When placed against any form of ID, such as a driver's license, birth certificate, or passport, the cypher instantly transforms into a perfect copy of that ID, including photos, watermarks, and any other identifying or verifying features. The duplicate lasts for a number of days equal to the cypher level.
    

###### REPAIR MODULE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Remote control, bullet, needle and thread
    
- **Effect:** Repairs a single device or machine of any kind (up to the level of the cypher) once. This could work on an artifact, a computer, a piece of lab equipment, a mechanical cider press, a furnace, and so on. The user doesn't need any knowledge of the machine or what's wrong with it, but they must be able to touch the machine and continue to do so for the length of the repair. The repair takes one minute per level of the machine.
    

###### SAFE SPACE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** App, knitted scarf, letter
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to create a temporary safe space around them that takes the form of their choosing, such as a bed, bathroom, mossy grove, and so on. The place looks, sounds, and feels just as the user imagines it. During that time, no one and nothing outside the space can see, hear, or interact with the user in any way, nor can they see, hear, or interact with anything outside their safe space. While in their safe space, they restore a number of points equal to the cypher level, distributing them as they see fit among their Pools. When they return, it's as though they never went away and no time has passed. They can remain in the space for up to one hour per cypher level.
    

###### SCREEN CONTROL 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** App, mirror, granny square
    
- **Effect:** A technological screen (a television, computer monitor, smartphone, or the like) within short range shows whatever the user wishes for up to one minute per cypher level. The display can be pictures, text, or meaningless shapes and colors.
    

###### SOCIAL BATTERY 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Battery, doll, feather
    
- **Effect:** Allows you to recharge your social battery, providing you with an asset on all positive social interactions, including persuasion, charm, flirtation, and succor. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### SOUL SAVER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 126)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Egg, battery, cross-stitch square
    
- **Effect:** Brings a dead creature whose level is equal to or less than the cypher's back to life for ten minutes per cypher level. PCs are automatically brought back for the duration. The creature is exactly as they were in life, with the same stats, personality, knowledge, and so on, but only has 2 points of health or Might. If the creature's health or Might Pool is healed to full in some way during this time, they return to life permanently, but with a 3-point reduction in their maximum health or Might Pool.
    

###### STAY DOWN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Nail polish, glove, stick
    
- **Effect:** Upon activating the cypher, the user's hand crackles with power and noise. They emit a concussive blast at a single foe within long range, inflicting 3 points of damage, knocking them prone, and stunning them for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.
    

###### TAKE ME THERE 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Crayon, chalk, lipstick
    
- **Effect:** The user spends a few rounds drawing a map of somewhere they're trying to get to. Even if the map is not the least bit accurate, they will sense a thread of magic leading them to their desired destination. If the place they seek is hidden, they must make an Intellect roll against its level to see if they succeed (the cypher provides an asset). The thread lasts for one day per cypher level or until they reach their destination, whichever is sooner.
    

###### TALK TO ME 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Spiderweb, flyer, building blocks
    
- **Effect:** The user can talk to any creature that is part of a structure, such as a mermaid in a fountain statue, a stone gargoyle on a skyscraper, or a dragon-shaped doorbell on a private home. The user can ask them a number of questions equal to the cypher level and get true answers. The questions must pertain to something the creature would know, such as something they saw or heard in the area, something they felt, or who made them.
    

###### TELEPORTATION BLOCK 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Bird's nest, remote control, building block
    
- **Effect:** A short area within immediate range of the user becomes warded against any teleportation effect or other ability that allows travel without direct physical movement (including abilities specifically meant to get around obstacles, such as  Bypass Barrier). Any creature whose level is less than the cypher level can't use these methods to get in or out. Player characters using such abilities must succeed at an Intellect-based task with a difficulty equal to the cypher level in order to enter or leave the area. The block lasts for one day per cypher level.
    

###### THROUGH THE WINDOW 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** App, mirror, flyer
    
- **Effect:** The user chooses any window they can see, and they are able to look through it as if they were standing right in front of it. The window does not need to be transparent, the user does not need to stay in sight of the window after they choose it, and no one else can perceive what they're doing. While they are looking through the window, they can wink to change their vision back to their current location, then wink again to return to the window. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level or until they choose to end it.
    

###### TIME TICKET 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 127)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Bus ticket, moss, remote control
    
- **Effect:** For the next day, no matter what time the user leaves or what hurdles they encounter, they will arrive exactly on time for the event, ride, or other activity. Busses and planes will not leave without them, the play or movie will not start until they arrive, and they'll meet people exactly when they said they would. (Note that this doesn't change how the user gets there—they may still sit in traffic forever or get stuck in the security line.) Their traveling companions, if any, enjoy the same benefit as long as they stick with the user.
    

###### TUNNEL TRAVERSER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Coveralls, poncho, knitted scarf
    
- **Effect:** When activated, it turns the wearer into a liquid or gaseous form of themselves, allowing them to travel through small spaces, such as air ducts, sewer tunnels, tight caverns, and so on. Efforts to detect the user are hindered by two steps (or three steps if the cypher is level 5 or higher), even by magic or security systems. The spaces must be at least 1 foot (30 cm) in diameter and must not be blocked by rocks, doors, and so on. The effect lasts for ten minutes per cypher level.
    

###### WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Potion, herbs, candle
    
- **Effect:** Restores a number of points equal to the cypher level to the user's choice of Pools. In addition, the user adds +3 to their next recovery roll.
    

###### WHO'S LOOKING 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Remote control, glass eye, stone with a hole
    
- **Effect:** For the next ten minutes per cypher level, the cypher vibrates any time the user is being monitored, watched, or tracked by something of the cypher level or less. This includes people, devices, security systems, cameras, spells, and so on.
    

###### WIRE WRAITH 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Wire, broken electronics, phone charger
    
- **Effect:** Activating the cypher creates a large wraithlike being that looks as if it's formed from wire. The wraith is a level 4 incorporeal construct that inflicts 4 points of electrical damage (ignores Armor) with its touch when directed. While the construct persists, the user can use it to slip through small areas, carry an electrical current, or attack foes. It lasts for a number of rounds equal to the cypher level.
    

###### WRECKING BALLS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Baseball, bouncy ball, marble
    
- **Effect:** When thrown, the ball multiplies into a number of itself equal to the cypher level. Each ball bounces once and then slams into targets within long range chosen by the user. The impact of each ball does 2 points of ambient damage (ignores Armor). If the same foe is hit by two or more balls, they are also knocked prone for one round.
    

###### YOU'RE SAFE NOW 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 128)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Suspenders, lapel pin, spiderweb
    
- **Effect:** Once the user activates the cypher, it protects them from ambient damage. The next time they would take ambient damage, such as from falling off a roof or being electrocuted by a power line, the cypher absorbs all of the damage (up to the cypher level).
    

##### APPS AS CYPHERS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 118)

Apps are a great cypher option for modern, urban settings. The character will need a working device, such as a cell phone or a  cloud storage artifact, to buy, download, or otherwise gain apps. However, in most cases the device doesn't need to be working to activate the app. Draining the device's battery or turning it off doesn't affect the app or someone's ability to use it. (Breaking the device, losing it, or having it stolen might be another matter.)

Because each app is a unique magical item (meaning only one exists in the world, unlike a regular app, which can be downloaded by everyone who wants it), they're harder to find than regular apps. Instead, you likely need to purchase one directly from the person who created it. Some campaign settings might have physical app stores, while others might require clandestine trades, electronic thievery, or some other means of securing the app. In other settings, an app might be something you download into a modified body part or integrated piece of hardware.

###### EASYMAGIC.APP 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 129)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** App
    
- **Effect:** Adds +1 to the user's Intellect Edge (+2 for cypher level 5 or higher) for the next 24 hours, but only for the purpose of casting spells.
    
    When the cypher is activated, the user attracts the attention of a malevolent  internet d@emon, who slides into their internet-connected devices and starts draining their magic. The d@emon remains even after the cypher's duration expires.
    

###### MALWARE CYPHERS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 129)

 EasyMagic.app has a beneficial effect, but also a serious drawback—it attracts a hostile creature to prey upon the user's magic. The cypher is significantly better than a typical  Edge-augmenting cypher like an  Intellect booster (lasting 24 hours instead of one hour) in order to trick a naive or greedy character into activating it. Magicians well-versed in cypher lore (and human nature) recognize that this sort of thing is too good to be true.

The GM should feel free to create similar kinds of malware app cyphers that are somewhat better than the standard ones in this chapter or in the  Chapter 24: Cyphers, and give them a harmful side effect. Example malware cypher benefits are  curatives that add more points or affect two  Pools at once,  Effort enhancers that can be used two or more times in an hour, and  perfections that don't require an action to activate (and therefore can affect a roll on the same turn the user activates the cypher).

Example malware cypher drawbacks are hindering the user's attack spells, debiting the user's bank account, monitoring the user's in-person or magical communications, deleting the user's other  magical app cyphers, compelling the user to take a specific action, "locking" one of the user's spells until they pay a ransom, accessing private data such as passwords or photos, and so on.

Other common malware cypher names are WarlockAntivirus, SpellManager, HexCleaner, TomeBot, and ScryBlocker.

#### MODERN FANTASY ARTIFACTS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 130)

If  cyphers are the expendable magic that is ever-present in fantasy,  artifacts are the more durable magic items that can be used over and over again—tomes of weird magic, magical vehicles, and so on. Unlike cyphers, there is no limit to how many artifacts a character can bear.

- **Effect:** The action figure carries a number of accessories equal to the artifact level. When the button on their back is pushed, the action figure does nothing, but their accessories grow to the size they would be if they were real, and they become functional. They remain this way for a day. Roll a d20 for each accessory the action figure might carry.

###### ASK ME ANYTHING 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Magic billiard ball fill with liquid, inside of which a small gargoyle, crow, or other creature floats
    
- **Effect:** The user can shake the magic ball, causing the creature inside to wake up. They can ask the creature two questions about the future and learn the answer (three questions if the artifact is level 4 or higher, four questions if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Because the future is ever-changing, the answers may not line up perfectly with what will happen, but they usually offer at least one piece of concrete, actionable information.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

###### ATHENEUM OF THE MIND CARD 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Metal and glass card about the size and shape of a library card
    
- **Effect:** Allows the user to "borrow" people's minds the same way that one might borrow a library book. The person must be agreeable to sharing their knowledge and must be within short range of the user when the exchange happens. For the next 24 hours, the user has access to the person's brain from anywhere, allowing them to become trained in two noncombat skills or specialized in one noncombat skill. The skill they choose must make sense for the person whose brain they're "borrowing" (for example, a professor of English lit would likely be skilled in speed-reading and storytelling, but maybe not in woodworking or cooking). They can only borrow one person's mind each day.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100
    

###### ATTEMPTED MURDER 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Tattoo of a flock of crows located anywhere on the body
    
- **Effect:** When the tattoo is activated, the crows fly out of it in a barrage of attacks. Everyone and everything in an immediate area suffers damage equal to the artifact level, unless they are designated safe by the user ahead of time.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6 (when the artifact depletes, the tattoo flies away and disappears)
    

###### BATTERY OF THE VANQUISHED 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Small metal pipe that's been etched with elaborate symbols
    
- **Effect:** After killing a magical creature, the user can place the pipe against the body and suck the creature's magic up into their body. The creature must have been slain by the user, they must be magical in some way, and they must have died within the last hour. The user restores a number of points equal to the artifact level to their Intellect Pool (even if this temporarily puts them above their maximum Pool).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

###### BLADE OF THE ROSES 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 133)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Handcrafted sword etched with vines and roses
    
- **Effect:** This sword is a medium weapon that inflicts 5 points of damage (6 points if the artifact is level 6 or higher). Additionally, on the first successful attack against a foe, the sword sows a rose vine into the creature's heart. The vine begins to spread through the creature's veins, inflicting 2 additional points of damage each round for one day or until magic is used to remove the vine. A PC can end the effect early by succeeding on a Might defense roll on their turn.

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Backpack, purse, or duffel covered in patches
    
- **Effect:** This bag can hold a number of magic items (including cyphers and artifacts) equal to the artifact level. Every item the user places inside the bag instantly turns into a patch on the bag's surface. Only the user can recognize these patches as the objects they once were, and only the user can turn them back into their original items (doing so takes an action). The bag can also be used as a regular bag to hold mundane items, which does not affect how many magic items it can hold. Cyphers in the bag do not count against the user's cypher limit.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (roll each time a magic item is added)
    

###### BUSY BOX

- **Effect:** Opening the box reveals a dazzling array of enticing things to do, see, hear, and experience. These enticements are magically geared to those experiencing them. Everyone who fails an Intellect defense roll within short range of the box is so distracted that they're hindered on all actions for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level. (NPCs whose level is less than the artifact level are automatically affected.) The remote will open and close the box from up to long range away.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

They can activate the cypher app directly from the ring or download it into a device of their choice. The ring can only hold one app at a time, and that app does count against the user's cypher limit.

###### COLOR CANNON 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 134)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Can of spray paint modified to spray from three different nozzles
    
- **Effect:** Depending on which nozzle is used, the color cannon has the following effects with a successful attack roll by the user.
    
    - _Fear._ Sprays a target within short range with a beam of color that frightens them so badly that they flee for a number of rounds equal to the artifact level.
    - _Stun._ Sprays a target within short range with a beam of color that stuns them for one round, making them lose their next action.
    - _Tag._ Tags a target within long range with a symbol. All tasks involving tracking, following, and finding that target are eased for the next day. No matter where the symbol lands, the tag still works (for example, if the target's shirt is tagged, the tag works even if they remove their shirt).
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

- **Form:** Pocket-sized figurine of a crow, its feathers worn from being lovingly petted over time
    
- **Effect:** For as long as the user carries the figurine on their person and does not actively harm, scare, or otherwise offend any living corvids, a flock of crows may show up randomly once per day to assist them. The crows arrive on their own time and act as crows do, attempting to help the user in the way that they deem most useful, such as dropping stones on a foe's head, warning them of incoming dangers, bringing them a snack, and so on.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100 (roll each time the crows arrive)
    

###### CROWN OF THE HIGH KING

###### DRAGON PEN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 135)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Quill made from a green feather
    
- **Effect:** The user can dip the pen in ink and draw an object or creature, which becomes real for one minute. The object or creature's level is half the artifact's level, +1 level if the user is trained in drawing, or +2 levels if the user is specialized in drawing. Once released from the page or surface it was drawn upon, the object or creature swells until it reaches the appropriate size, but it grows no bigger than an immediate distance in width, depth, and height. If a creature is made, it does the bidding of the user.
    
    Someone familiar with magic made from drawings or illustrations, such as someone who has the  Inks Spells on Skin focus, can use the pen as part of casting their spells, easing the task of casting the spell.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

###### EAU DE BLOOD AND MONSTERS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 135)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Red crystal bottle filled with amber perfume
    
- **Effect:** This perfume is specially created to be used by a single person. To activate it for the first time, the user must put a single drop of their blood into the bottle, incorporating their own scent into that of the perfume. The result smells amazing to them but is not noticeable to anyone else.
    
    After that, whenever the user applies the perfume, it provides +2 Armor (+3 if the artifact is level 9 or higher). Each application lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, and it's an action to reapply the perfume.
    
    Anyone else who attempts to wear the perfume quickly realizes it smells awful on their skin, and they take 1 point of damage.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20
    

###### ECOSENSITIVE FRIDGE MAGNETS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Set of refrigerator magnets (two of each letter and two of each number 0 through 9) made out of bone or wood
    
- **Effect:** Ghosts, haunts, wraiths, poltergeists, and other spectral creatures can move these objects as easily as a human can, using them to spell out messages visible to anyone in the area. Usually, the magnets are also enchanted so these creatures can't remove them from the surface they're attached to (preventing the creatures from stealing, hiding, or throwing them).
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each day of use); depletion means one of the magnets is lost forever but the remainder continue to function

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 1
    
- **Form:** Long black blade with a carved stone handle
    
- **Effect:** A successful attack with the blade doesn't inflict physical damage. Instead, it fills the foe's mind with dark and dangerous thoughts, inflicting 4 points of Intellect damage (6 points if the artifact Is level 5 or higher) that ignore Armor. The foe does not need to be corporeal for the attack to be successful.
    
- **Depletion:** —
    

###### HISTORY'S FICKLE HANDS 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 136)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Watch with a beautiful leather band and silver face whose hands and numbers move in a seemingly random order
    
- **Effect:** The watch works as a two-way communication device to someone in the past whose level is equal to or less than the artifact level. A screen opens up on the watch face that allows the user to see the person and interact with them. The person isn't compelled to interact with the user, and the user's interaction with them doesn't change anything in the present or future. The connection stays open for ten minutes per artifact level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d6
    

###### KEYS OF CLOSE TO YOU 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Two small gold keys, each with a simple bow
    
- **Effect:** When activated by two people standing together, the bows of the keys magically adjust to create an abstract representation of the two users' relationship. At any time, one of the users can teleport themselves to the other person instantly, from up to 50 miles (80 km) away. For this to work, both people must have their key on their person, and there must be no magical barriers in place that are higher level than the artifact.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20 (check each teleportation)
    

###### LIVING COPYCAT 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 137)

- **Level:** 1d6
    
- **Form:** Collection of metal magnets in a small tin
    
- **Effect:** If the user spends about an hour shaping the metal magnets into a copy of a living entity they've seen or have an image of, such as a human, cat, or dragon, the living metal takes the shape of that entity (albeit at about a tenth of its size). The copycat does and says everything that the living entity is doing, at the moment that they're doing it. The copycat lasts for ten minutes per artifact level, after which it returns to a collection of magnets.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

- **Level:** 1d6 + 2
    
- **Form:** Thumb drive with the image of a lamp engraved on it
    
- **Effect:** Inserting the thumb drive into a device produces the avatar of a genie who grants the user a single wish. The GM assigns a level to the wish, so the larger and more difficult the wish, the more difficult it is to have the wish granted. Generally, a wish such as gaining an asset or inexpensive item is level 1, and a wish for an expensive item or for a foe to vanish is level 7. The genie cannot grant a wish above its level. The genie can grant only one wish per day.

- **Effect:** The ring creates a "meatboy," a level 1 lifelike simulation of a human, who appears within immediate range. The meatboy has only a limited vocabulary and ability to reason. It does as the user instructs for one minute, then slumps, melts into reddish goo, and vanishes.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 137)

The porridge is non-allergenic, gluten free, dairy free, meat free, and cruelty free.

- **Form:** Red gold ring engraved with a chaotic bullet pattern
    
- **Effect:** When targeted with a ranged attack from a firearm that fires bullets, the wearer can attempt a hindered Speed defense roll. If the roll succeeds, the bullet rebounds before hitting the wearer and immediately returns to the sender, effectively granting the wearer a free attack against the shooter fired from the shooter's weapon. The wearer is practiced with this attack.

###### SONG OF THE SIREN 

(IT'S ONLY MAGIC, PAGE 138)

- **Level:** 1d6 + 3
    
- **Form:** Safety whistle in the shape of a woman with bird wings and a fish tail
    
- **Effect:** Blowing into the whistle creates no sound, but instead causes a siren to appear. The siren sings a brief song.

- **Effect:** Allows the user to quickly read and understand almost anything within short range, such as a book, long article, important document, and so on, even if it's not in a language they know. Reading something usually takes at least a few rounds, depending on the length of the item.
    
    For the next ten minutes per artifact level, the user remembers everything they read perfectly, and if they take any actions pertaining to that knowledge, their task is eased. At the end of that time, all of their newly gained knowledge disappears. They can only use the speed readers on the same item once.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

- **Effect:** Allows the user to shapeshift into the form of the creature depicted in the tattoo. The creature is nearly impossible to tell from other creatures of its ilk, meaning it's the same size, moves the same way, vocalizes the same way, has the same coloration, and so on. Once shapeshifted, the user can only do things that the creature could do in its normal state, such as run, roar, fly, swim, and so on. They cannot do things as a human would, but they could talk as a raven might talk, use a device as a primate might, and so on. The shapeshifted user otherwise retains their base stats. The form lasts for ten minutes per artifact level.
    
- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d20

- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d10
    

Because tattoo artifacts are magical, they can be transferred from one person's skin to another's. For example, if a character kills someone with a still-usable tattoo, they can press their skin to the tattoo and it will appear on their body.

- **Level:** 1d6 + 4
    
- **Form:** Watch with no face and no hands

The user cannot change anything about the experience, but they can replay and slow down the video. The video lasts for a number of minutes equal to the artifact level and disappears after. Note that while the video of the past is always accurate, the video of the future shows one of many possible futures and may not come true.

- **Form:** Handheld mirror or small vanity with a special button shaped like a crown
    
- **Effect:** The user activates the artifact by pressing the button and staring into the mirror for one minute.

- **Depletion:** 1 in 1d100 (check each hour of extra time granted to the user); after depletion, its magic stops working but it continues to function as a normal mirror

- **Depletion:** — (At any time, the GM can rule that the onesie has resisted enough Intellect attacks to deplete that ability, after which it still functions as armor.)
